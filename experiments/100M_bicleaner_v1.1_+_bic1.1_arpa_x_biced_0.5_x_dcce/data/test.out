28 @-@ year @-@ old Koch in San Francisco Mall found dead
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the Department of Health in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations were underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , took his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed by his death &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia granted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; Louis Gar@@ cia told K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia told him that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to connect his kind with his family was to cook us always something , prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is requested to invo@@ ke the display of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star in an interview is now unmistak@@ ably clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more cat@@ chy to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
the act@@ ress spends most of her time at home , in front of a TV with local de@@ bris and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film will be on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 year old it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the horses remembered their feast , they were hunting for their food in the fast gal@@ lop .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - again close to horses .
he settled with his family on the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even shoot for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Sports Aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; handed the man out of An@@ hausen to the Golden Sport Pyr@@ amid at a small gala . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ ton lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen bl@@ amed him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is for@@ given not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering the generation for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends have come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp are looking for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are at odds with tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep those in doubt small and cau@@ tions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will turn regul@@ ators back heavily , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the need to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical ap@@ lic@@ it wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp there could be party internal discussions .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tru@@ mp plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to cancel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ d trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also be paid better , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to rise , then he says he cannot be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who at least wants to demand of the rich wants them to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women are sitting .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for all @-@ cold women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid Association .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope carriers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have made experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that the tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who thinks that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worst mis@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about what is experienced , because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations only for them , called B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether or not they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
there is no such thing in the Govern@@ ments of Govern@@ ments in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ian women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be kept separate from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy or will men and women be accommodated together , it can become - perpet@@ ually - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that is given to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike : demands for new employment measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
representatives of the assistance doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new employment measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work action from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have given ministers to deal with the concerns of the contract .
assistance specialists and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A in July .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and solic@@ it official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour combat actions starting in early September .
the disputes led to assistance doctors of six times , the first general failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assist doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , so that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the agreement for doctors in England would be mandatory .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ row@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report entire five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
his enthusiasm for me seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness demonstrated that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin announced and accused Ankara that Russia fell in the back .
the off@@ ence was even bigger , since it was done by a supposed boy@@ friend .
rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media performed a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
at the most serious , alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire are clearly obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in almost his office last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken it .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved in Russia if the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forec@@ asted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti stipul@@ ated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there lang , tomatoes here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin &apos;s sn@@ ail pace - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; two countries that break from the West and feel bad and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey broke off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State will talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Chairman of the Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambitions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be nearly collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brands &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange down to Nat@@ West are exchanged .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customers that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor &apos;s brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global targets , but to pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be totally different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori accepts the jubil@@ ation when he picks up the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career prospects
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , just a few before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a fans have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6.000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden for almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying discs , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat@@ race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ th birthday .
Russian Putin ste@@ ers Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s closest vote of confidence for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transportation Opport@@ unities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , Putin is said to have ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been Vice President since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in Tall@@ inn , Estonia , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the site of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the director of the management and staff of the regi@@ stran@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s main task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns on their own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who was once promoted as a potential President , once again wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin to be quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated item - one could almost say - entr@@ en@@ ched posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia since a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally by Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved last month on a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement its cancellation .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal on Thursday .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is published , will probably be published at a later date according to the position of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart &apos;s blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fishes , who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could be Sand@@ a@@ ale for the 75 fish that were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ or Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown presented a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck at its place and the final section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first clasp represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap in the north or the country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very cheerful activity .
massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
he@@ avi@@ est , as the toler@@ ances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they em@@ bed only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blow the boat out of reach until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast@@ guard boots and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who have been thrown into the water have un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine had an emergency stop , but it dis@@ b@@ anded in the bo@@ oting of the boots from the person who was steering the boat .
someone has guarded these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the keys to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he st@@ owed twice upon her .
the 44 year old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be put much stronger in the future in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap dwell@@ ings over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is lacking until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction program , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , is intended to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible to investors .
the left is still aiming for tough@@ er conditions for investors .
regardless of this , as Brat@@ mann , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet fully : because the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how can we offset the loss of other roughly 1300 cheap dwell@@ ings , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the spokesperson for planning , Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of taking homes back into price relationship .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , fri@@ sts are running out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price @-@ binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased again , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called interference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few urban districts will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens count on the fact that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
admitt@@ edly , I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and luck , worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then vide@@ og@@ ames and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 1990s ( later it created a animated series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand dropped in early July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS , and once they have been found , they can be &quot; captured &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person puts back every day .
car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch who pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train each day for 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look eli@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y toys , which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has occurred a breakthrough .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track down our activity earlier , they did not give us a reason to play sports , as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
due to Pok@@ emon &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ ler manages gold in the ladies @-@ tower
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast passed on Thursday to the title of the title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi @-@ competition title and holds the fifth , while she has established her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has won the last three years her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that she said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she awaited a final test in Brazil , a competition which did not go so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as disappointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace herself after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although it insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force .
since summer 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina guided by two turns , the picture sh@@ attered .
floating beams and ground ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ stein holds the world title - lau@@ ert .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish bar - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly when she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ ge shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team @-@ cap , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her tur@@ mo@@ il she threw up the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as it is concerned , the rapidly spread T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims of mass murder when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks of Phoenix in one of the dead@@ liest attacks have been killed in the car and listened to music in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ piece , while he stood on the passenger &apos;s side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ over@@ f@@ eit because the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine ass@@ aults within four months and two more wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder , and it was assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as least of his age , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was I can &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained .
Ed@@ mund can help with a help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he slowly progres@@ ses .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought about &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language to him , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected people infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me anyone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainf@@ alls , flooding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale flooding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding in extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood early warning system was used on Friday , while it was ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still be@@ headed people from flooding in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed close to Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another boot @-@ man who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river during the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer was reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground had been fully weighed down by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities gave an indication that heavy rain and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a lesson in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa also attacked 200 houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were now both flooded .
the leader of the commune of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals that were r@@ ins@@ ed from the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were arranged to house the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and provided sand bags for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to be flooded during Thursday , but on Friday they were not reported .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tell that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including in the lung , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at the hospital in his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ aton@@ z the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is likely to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , there were bus@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently under review of the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a ag@@ ger at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ es@@ hip in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that is for more than one reason .
first of all , since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lic@@ in , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising winner of the Olympic Games and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ly gy@@ nec@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ astic classes all over the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic partnership will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality is such that gymnas@@ tics are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts first and foremost in private trainers who are maintained for training , furnishing , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued as you wish .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is a te@@ dious and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the municipalities au@@ n innum@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gymnas@@ tics training .
I founded my gym of 20 years .
during my events , we have free and affordable Harlem gymn@@ asts for more than 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which make it possible to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of Girl Power through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance specialists would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted for election refused him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance doctors are expected to receive a new contract , which contains changes to bed@@ side and weekend shifts in order to improve the maintenance of the clock .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance doctors announced last night in a message with : &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular , that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by discussions prompted the government to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was due to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done only last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further action measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide medical doctors on the strip chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 veter@@ in@@ arians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action measures achieve nothing of the only little , but have already stra@@ ined teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have talked to the assistant doctors &quot; committee and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries to the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional time , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holiday and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after the authorities have been advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is given to a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot causing the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ logging the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons already having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca by British company and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former member of the cabinet , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that in@@ timi@@ dation from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of election cab@@ s to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead a card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er must only call his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to a person &apos;s finger when they release their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it demands that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only for election fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial investment culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ist and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm for the frau@@ dul@@ ent let@@ ter@@ press - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including guiding ID to prove identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence has been added that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit post@@ code documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picking up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists edit complete brief@@ ings and envel@@ opes from post @-@ elections .
the police have the power to set up barriers to election stations .
a change of law which facilitates an accus@@ ation because of in@@ timi@@ dation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Law 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing at election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff usually enforce that voters go alone in the cabin .
Sir Eric drops across the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poll@@ ing court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uties for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Jud@@ gement in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heritage as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only athlete to have gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one is allowed to give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ rt at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates &apos;s double @-@ go@@ ers on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US squ@@ ad in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks very similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I &apos;ll take that as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the SA s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ er@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the similarities too
theory into space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; went down &quot; like M@@ ief and died during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style floating squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , going down like M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second leg of the floating squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and language .
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not captured that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free @-@ style floating squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard at which many asked him to speak .
Twitter users didn &apos;t stop when they heard how un@@ sensi@@ tively B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We are sorry that the comment on a swimming performance was broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with the people responding to the emer@@ gen@@ cies about Twitter
the colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements have been made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night with our audience on show and our followers in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic games , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

they continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman pro@@ pped the under@@ pants before putting her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she recovered and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ghts and pants and tasted it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to come out and went out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to dis@@ rupt someone watching - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Pri@@ mark speaker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber .
when you &apos;re approaching from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the att@@ acker fle@@ es from pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
at the same time , keep the weight on your weapon and beat the att@@ acker on your chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in case of a rob@@ bery it is the saf@@ est to cover your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller subjected his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test - by dra@@ gging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his train on a euro note , a rail@@ ings at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the leak of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought of dump@@ ing the rin@@ se button of a pulling toilet which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known for testing the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to r@@ ins@@ ing pots of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he met his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after her L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of Mil@@ ky Products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the worst thing I &apos;ve done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had told him , just like the ec@@ el@@ dy Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these fil@@ thy treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in irre@@ parable condition .
the walls had clear holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer able to repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who in the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and floods included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to be inv@@ oked regularly by the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte them and her partner forci@@ bly by the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to freely withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ cs were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals for 20 years .
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will offer comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house management will now have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skel@@ don was granted a fine after own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial custody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 at a car accident .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will navigate r@@ enter who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal put in panic after a flying military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese plane P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces put an unbelievable crash
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a flying jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun@@ ba@@ the in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the engines , without first seeing what came to them by the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats in front of the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokesperson said that due to the bad visibility the jet flew lower than usual due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people on the island of Madeira to die .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to circumstances - heavy fog and smoke smoke - which restric@@ ts his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first time in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash takes three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ gew@@ inner needs to ren@@ ounce Ne@@ ym@@ ar with the defeated cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europe League champion , who won the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the first time in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years now .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique has refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applications has the advantage .
before the first mandatory game of the new season there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in the final stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
Sevilla , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona has eleven successes of the record winner in this application .
Ma Long in its own league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) .
the World R@@ ank@@ ers first took the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and the Olympia .
bronze passed to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected in the final game and made the title to each other .
thus it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn from the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches up to this point I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold and Silver Med@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; posed with the China flag . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expectedly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed .
however , nevertheless , sufficient stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Mas@@ ut@@ ani won the Bronze medal against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
the White Russia suffered a ri@@ b injury in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ char@@ ov , after that , in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle down with tin .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were incidentally in similarly high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp grants &quot; huge problems ″ in the election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp announced the weakness of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , the doubts about his success are growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp ahead of evangel@@ ical Christians asking for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to false reports of his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media hul@@ ls .
Republi@@ can bur@@ gers w@@ ob@@ ble
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by the Sur@@ vey@@ or of June , Tru@@ mp and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were at the same time .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by far the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the broad@@ caster CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clin@@ tons &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and sne@@ ak back : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very beautiful , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing else but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not reach him for reasons of political correctness , Tru@@ mp said further .
then I return to a very good lifestyle .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is said to have threatened to raise funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values .
instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will be able to get stronger under arms for Congress .
Olympics : tri@@ ster Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened by the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
after a sc@@ out attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer at home .
the International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan minister told us that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , delivered a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was reported to Kenya &apos;s team leadership by the dop@@ ing controllers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IA@@ AF world association submitted the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesman announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the ensu@@ ing measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i , released and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of State Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against the athlete of his country .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic Games start .
as a result , WA@@ DA participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD has repeatedly raised accus@@ ations that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been demonstrated that in this type of sport , there was a widespread and systematic gene opt @-@ out .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli is playing an older Mary .
she remembered her love with Tony , while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musically exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is wise , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli gives back the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
it is the same subjects , and they are just as meaningful today as then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e , said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had decided to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from the East of London entered a plane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land as candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next President will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expecting from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Rei@@ d said later that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also noted Donald Tru@@ mp was in@@ appropriate for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distinguishes as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks it does the Calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classical nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; anyone who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proxim@@ ate Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish municipality of Germany reck@@ ons on the short term with tens of thousands of protective hunters who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of prot@@ ections from Turkey in Germany in the medium term , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already taken over Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ act@@ ments some months ago , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the put@@ sch put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
so Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the S &amp; D Group called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire marking as Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and secular people , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proxim@@ ate Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on reference to the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already set up the largest group of asylum holders recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and nearly 29 per cent of all identified as asylum @-@ seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey you will not find those who are paid before war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the summer holidays the country &apos;s election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more stupid than now it &apos;s not about : summer holidays , heat and land w@@ rest@@ ling - that bites itself .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the fighters , are on vacation .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during vac@@ ations , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up votes are just ar@@ du@@ ous to apply .
until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in p@@ olls .
exciting is how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D inter@@ sec@@ ts and what remains in the end of coalition @-@ proof .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees off his big posters .
he travels through the country , spreading roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ m@@ less predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , seaf@@ ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel is bl@@ aming the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale talks ; Angela Merkel is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel at once .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election conditions on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ king , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you are br@@ ushing the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly there in the vast@@ ness of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U @-@ campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hurt , namely where people are : village festivals , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called out its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 per cent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just slightly ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clearly gaining 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and transfer their electoral campaign largely to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local voters on their holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the leading candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the lakes of Mecklenburg and also finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : inn@@ s suffer from blocking
in the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and only end at 8@@ pm , there are everywhere praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything quite sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ob@@ jects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to furnishing homes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site has mig@@ rated south@@ wards on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ don@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now go on both sides from O@@ fan@@ dingen to the B 27 .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ stitutes highway , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were seeking and more familiar with their navigation than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality increased the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself knowled@@ geable on the spot himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have already been heated two to three per minute .
the fastest one was on the road with 77 hours per hour at the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that now the road is open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales out@@ breaks can be seen through every one you ask .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the car deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; course is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential @-@ threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street renovation took its business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , answered with the hint that the restaurant benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other county districts , where things have been handled more gener@@ ously .
in all col@@ la@@ ges G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less frequently passing by because of complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you cannot go down , it is also nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his stem cell comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 works on its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its host in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly ro@@ using . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they demand no one .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was in a position and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent proposals in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , a little time has come to pass before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some thing is already known , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the ch@@ opping of encrypted communication is not new .
also , it is not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU targets on air passenger data and weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities also comes as no surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launched a second trial for proposals that had not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to punish sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups and push the German passport with double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything , which doesn &apos;t have any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick @-@ procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of an asylum seek@@ er rejected asylum seekers , he wants to face some even worse than previously - such as com@@ mitting criminal off@@ ences or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to mask their identity .
some of them are politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened .
many things are still un@@ expressed and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the im@@ treatment of patient ones for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high refugee figures , many people were worried about security .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with people could not be cl@@ en@@ ched in election times as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner security is enormously put into focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are suff@@ rage fights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly confronted with internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , the two parties went up high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a poor argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here to reconci@@ le tones .
from a turning away from the double pass , he thinks nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made the discussion in Germany satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it , do not make sense .
and with a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed first .
there &apos;s a lot of things to worry about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also the SPD is currently trying to improve the topic of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor does Volkswagen get off lightly .
despite the diesel prices , the delivery figures are rising worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vor@@ tex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen enters the second half of the year for deliveries .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer continues to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the VW @-@ brand , mainly in Western Europe , weak@@ ens the total sales as stated in the Da@@ x company .
the Volkswagen brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
deliveries in the home market of Germany declined by almost a sixth .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has given in some core markets a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was also bur@@ dened with the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust air has escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus sign .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected family brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen is further lightly compared with the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales Chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue selling a sales division from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate issued by the Customer , however , we do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
legal intri@@ c@@ acies are the reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power will not take place after the change@@ over and all type appro@@ vals relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen even uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen provides the opportunity for customers to come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could be traced back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal , there is uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criminal off@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from wealthy savers as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief Executive Officer Joseph Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay for their austerity measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks store money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest .
this fee will be charged by the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September onwards by private and corporate clients for deposits of more than € 100,000 on sight or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 cost in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he took over 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs are now passed on .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank Board .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other assets .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically permanently impossible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their bank account fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with criminal off@@ ences for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Financial Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay widespread fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it covers free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
famous actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no further banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ ban@@ ken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ ban@@ ken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to compete .
customers in Germany won &apos;t let that in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love boards .
before you ha@@ sten the comment section to susp@@ end it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ all@@ ot@@ sam &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to mi@@ dd@@ le@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a plate are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild ge@@ stu@@ li@@ ere before I stop , hold my hands and say something like that : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , dem ich von Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of Number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already treasure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are set to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I conducted , people usually have gotten rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom in adher@@ ents to the plate revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that ev@@ oke happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to focus on mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a record pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I leaf@@ ed through a pile of Bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came just recently here and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ rich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of newest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz in the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks odd , but serious psychological trauma is hard to imagine when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running in business for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it &apos;s more of a window shopping than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the appearance of mut@@ ing the jeans hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury objects like plates .
although my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they can be ignored , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stro@@ lling through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates , while they steer clear of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who over@@ looks unaware of middle @-@ aged middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to store 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which have a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary establishments , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is charitable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin continues to fight

&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup in view , remain confident and keep fighting , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyze the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed blades : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , to the severity of the accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on motorway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed limit , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary speed car for compliance with speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : the battery lasts for five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser technology can also capture all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans according to time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be fitted with each car with a trailer hook .
in order for it to not be cl@@ utter@@ ed easily , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also slip @-@ resistant outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data provided by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain reco@@ vers silver in the 7 @-@ franc Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
the UK &apos;s impressive performance during the 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
Fiji granted a master class in handling , side qu@@ il@@ ting , back@@ rest , line run , and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , a 15 @-@ man team would have been beaten in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for the UK - but it will probably not be that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , former boss of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago , under Ryan , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and caused GB@@ s to boun@@ ce off fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ li@@ cked in the corner .
after four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right hand , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a h@@ is@@ sing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the hill from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it just stopped .
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner down a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed through another weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and r@@ ushed to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB is still missing .
this is the way it is .
GB conducted basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an experiment for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ tan , whose fans sang , flags flew and danced at the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the fi@@ j@@ is rang , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB cr@@ ammed in the grass .
in the past on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning were inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer to victory
there will be no more vocal gold than in these games and that will mean something hot .
from the first strokes until the last 220 tough H@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though they were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was present when they rowed to the second Olympics in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who put such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , their 3@@ 9th un@@ defeated bet , which is likewise unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was an assistant than the coach , who did not know thirty months ago , if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes slightly the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
that is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts came to Williams who spent a more annoying morning to talk more than usual and tried to handle his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a little extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked for .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks goes to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or have a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even over the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , star@@ ters and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; remain in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking for something great .
today we didn &apos;t want fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set as a water@@ maker in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , buying land in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ modelling of water pipes .
there has never been a stand@@ still and you have always picked up new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a genuine practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken district .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ atten@@ dant and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the well @-@ known well @-@ known well @-@ being and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest use were the tu@@ b@@ ular break@@ age at church lou@@ der on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained only because the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt was filled with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who replaces Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed she had to die .
however , the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has come forward and learn now privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : when I ask him something which is two years back when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man shoots to life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and killed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called us and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him was publicly tra@@ cked .
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
in the meantime , the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is carrying a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially refused to provide information on the connection between perpetrators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing mess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ free and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs .
financial burdens that the industry threatened by green power are from the table .
it remains in the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing systems for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission has therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission to produce electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation worsen@@ ed further than the world &apos;s largest producer country , faced with the weak@@ ening domestic demand , threw masses of steel to the world market .
European manufacturers repro@@ ach Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import @-@ steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have emerged .
it is unclear how sustainable the prize collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally did not want to exclude closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Division announced on Friday .
after a brief climb in May , the crowd went back for the second month in a row .

community , spirit , health : singing old sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a chorus is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs don &apos;t get out of the box too fast in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people ev@@ okes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ fallen men dec@@ eive themselves on long rec@@ umbent events .
in singing , the head also demands a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and more alert than myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing are enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - in 50 singing people , who hears when a sound comes next to it ?
this is the best way to change , may you be rich and continue to help others . &#124;
if someone from the circle of friends sings in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a chorus , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers to scre@@ am of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect has the effect of cro@@ aching of cats on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ stress also left the males not cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the che@@ wing of the little ones .
they react by ten percent more quickly to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , as scientists have found at the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
she is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens are different with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens who were raised in addition .
despite the low sample , researchers consider their results to be meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have not yet their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ation of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans .
also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ er@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , Turkey plays an important football game again .
before the du@@ el of the arch @-@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : business as usual .
the government , the daily life of regular citizens , should not be affected by the fall of the state of emergency following the overthrow of the emergency state in July .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football , it does not stop .
the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be the follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is bl@@ amed by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
although the emergency state imposed initially for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this has virtually no effect on the lives of the majority of the Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks with dramatic experiences in history is the strict refusal of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially time for Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski to arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 year old finished his first playing time as the top sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also differ@@ ed early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South per Li@@ g , it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the base for the 14th title as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ pf@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig at the age of 26 .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in connection with the political situation in the country after the coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez , which was pending in the AC Florence under contract and in Bes@@ ik@@ tas , was not to be returned because of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the storm would have to be ready to for@@ ego about a third of its annual volume estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still going to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock right in front of the games , was mer@@ cil@@ essly thrown out at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it was a bizarre scene : with a raised smile she was still standing in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was established that she was not going to get gold , the audience broke out into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are many more sports@@ men who go to the Olympic Games in Rio , despite the D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion runs even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold world champion had to wait for a six month lock in 2010 after having demonstrated the use of the Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don pain .
after having had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European championship was tested positive for the banned Stim@@ ul@@ ans drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and has been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , be@@ amed Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athlete was recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympic silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championships because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the CA@@ S International Sports Court .
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Go@@ ing , China ) : the world record artist and Gold@@ fav@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship there were evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement , the block@@ age of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA was mil@@ der and ran off on 13 July .
bom@@ b@@ astic terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from cutting wounds and had been treated in hospital , but had already left it again .
she planned her home@@ ward journey for the beginning of September .
from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
in this regard , the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste .
about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and a further person was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Ph@@ u@@ ket .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that killed an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the Re@@ vier of the coastal police .
finally , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast required several injured .
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ vi@@ av@@ ee Frei@@ tag ahead of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - however , it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities in the past few days would have received secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still unclear which group was hiding behind the attacks .
the police found their officers all over the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not address tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bom@@ b@@ astic bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) is applicable to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution that was held by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military considerable influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves toward stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is dedicated to restoring the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
nearly a year ago , 20 people were killed at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several state offices , the Federal Constitutional Court also put the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are witn@@ essing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief executive officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are har@@ med in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it applies to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ären &quot; are already observing .
he said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities during the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief executive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not an advertisement for your own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ären &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have no knowledge about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the protection of constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the significant increase in ri@@ ghted criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Freiburg Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that other rights @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups arose at the regional level or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concerned , they expressed that there were many attacks on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the suspect in case of attacks on asylum seekers have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ tist who , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weigh@@ ted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 metres of free @-@ style .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired f@@ rene@@ tically at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

accidents - bus sli@@ ps into dit@@ ches in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ bir@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
according to her data , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate from a vice , partly on the counter @-@ track .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund told me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the passengers .
six emergency ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance arrived on the highway 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ ho@@ fen district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators asked the trucks and possible witnesses to sign up with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp , 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a volati@@ le calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the household by the district council Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that for these sewage installations , under@@ lies were opened .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ efficient manner .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as head of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage installations of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , there are also over@@ - or under@@ caps from the previous calculation period .
Schmidt explained the serious increase in revenue in all three sewage installations by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the amount of wastewater generated in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the past calculation period in all three plants , not least due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground and after almost 20 years , the first sewage treatment plant had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses have resulted in the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same goes for electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water case in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully sm@@ ashed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt continued to spare the market town of great entertainment costs in the sewage installations over the past 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater utility company cannot be extended by these systems because they are defici@@ ent facilities .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
Sn@@ ap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its Filter@@ tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent to the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , proprietary tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps are open to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past when they were accused of promoting black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics named it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were spread widely on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat sh@@ ook that it would have disabled the feature .
the company ap@@ ologi@@ zed : the filter was designed as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism recalls the filter to vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student of art whose tweet has been widely used across the photos , that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and told uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osi@@ tion of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the de@@ war@@ ting extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in the hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and finished their essay using a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a narr@@ ator , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on sub@@ represented ethnic groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies ISIS intelligence information , states Committee of Congress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , reported a report of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , intelligence service committees and the military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically det@@ ectable by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly posted a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command &apos;s press releases , statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com An@@ dant publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
in addition , Cent@@ com &apos;s investigations are ongoing by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an excessive process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ cr@@ at in the Committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ rupted the morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence to have found any evidence of interven@@ ing in the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported cases of investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have an impact on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the critics concerning the secret information on the Islamic State recall inter@@ relations of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writing piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time left to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there were no significant effects on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States win fourth match in women &apos;s field hockey , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after shooting three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
this is what she knows : the American girls are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of them will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game starts on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 , she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London we now have .
we have completely ro@@ cked the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on your TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the queue , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a black s@@ warm with dim@@ ples , could certainly have been among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he is a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline tur@@ ret .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , in part in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I want to make a modest argument for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many who had questioned I did not know that it is an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 it had been an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than for the Olympics .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending up@@ beat - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports which it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring ski@@ ers jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and o@@ int@@ tos ) before landing on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official schedule of the Olympic programme , you will be judged according to the performance , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alists have to go to gold in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , up and down at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further highlight in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympia @-@ ord .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it is also what I feel we@@ ary when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the acquiring and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently suggested , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan community following air .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less according to human rights organisations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security professionals strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats across the region , notably in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , whereby dissi@@ dents are effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or pushed into the vast@@ ness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ Home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this fragile , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which have been forced more or less in recent years , would exploit the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of del@@ usion under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones became more and more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies who hide where they reside .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they had gathered so much protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered mainly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economics , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was his prime minister until his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in recognizing early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , has been chosen for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such a uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , apparently prosec@@ uted by the government and then stolen by the government .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and this period of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , and their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously , this did not prevent the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ sky flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his statement Obama has founded ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp attempted to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by attacking that his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings together its fellow @-@ stri@@ kers , who seek to take it in protection during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all .
after making the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp rest@@ led with regards to the alleg@@ ation on Thursday , and in interviews he insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was totally serious .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign for falling survey values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp attempted to return to this subject again .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech dull .
Mr. Tru@@ mp had already given sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism of himself when he thought that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I meant sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries of politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction drops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp assumed an even more et@@ ched tone , as his survey values continued to decline .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general seeks not to excuse his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he increasingly focuses his attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent inter@@ ces@@ sions , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was questioning Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statement whether Mr Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama , ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind legs , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton has served as the Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread themselves by allowing them to control the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and being taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s excuse as just a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presi@@ dency .
once disp@@ elled by the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store have been sup@@ planted .
the store so@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is changing , it is also a re @-@ invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , used a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ches like cap@@ ers and su@@ cked onions .
there are natural swe@@ at@@ eries .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the verb .
even after they moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb was closed she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was in the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she is drinking coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and faithful customer .
he went there before the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a s@@ wis@@ s watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that the soap business has taken up the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had planned to put them out soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice store would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee seemed like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a fai@@ ble for refin@@ ing Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Til@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Bri@@ ck@@ man was told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive trees while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
as the re@@ porter questioned Hack@@ ney , this found the couple matching a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man .
there were Pe@@ an@@ ut B@@ read , Li@@ ver Che@@ ese and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ads and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces the way the country was around to be no longer the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new budget : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; noted Bri@@ ck@@ man , as coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
while researching the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were such a thing of the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food attitude .
while he public@@ ises the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s cuisine in his kitchen , he fed as the millions @-@ million man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a nearly gold @-@ plated dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly realistic .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if Ele@@ an@@ or &apos;s wife had asked him to stamp an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the att@@ estation of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt showed that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country came back on its legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple showed a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man recalled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag @-@ incident .
after the plate was cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosevelt did eat at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick with modest recipes to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone has a little reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E got three times a hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives to others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone first aid .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil shield , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , said loud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in saving lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs on the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb so that no children are playing with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are born only with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
but this lifestyle , em@@ bos@@ sed by slow@@ ness , seems to be a bul@@ war@@ k for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , comments this li@@ fes@@ pan that is a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist gu@@ essed for a long time that Greenland sh@@ arks become stone .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sh@@ arks .
their slow motion sen@@ sed them when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ til@@ ise from higher water @-@ layers downward .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of animals , they analysed the l@@ enti@@ cular core of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the protein contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons scan increased large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res , the l@@ enti@@ l nucleus has a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons attempts , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their core nucleus , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously is at least one and a half centuries time .
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates too .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ises live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the old record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon neck on the neck was a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal feeds heat .
the heat loss of one gram of the mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with topics relating to construction , the municipal council has focused on the most recent session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with relief , the Board announced the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ i@@ fication and en@@ closures were clari@@ fied and the applications could be made on sur@@ veying , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and elderly sen@@ iors .
as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ ler can now announce in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting .
in order to make requests for the res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created land use plan in sections only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city of the Main has the best chances of attracting new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether banks will continue to operate in London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for them to be admitted to the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory agency E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk council ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is certainly home to a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin &apos;s infrastructure deterior@@ ates worse .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city offers easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxemburg on number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US District Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was exemp@@ t from a damages deposit amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ cks , including per@@ jur@@ ation and other un@@ ethical actions .
in the case of charging the law@@ suit on Thursday U.S. District Ju@@ dge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ se the costs incurred during the defense of the fall .
Mer@@ ck is trying to match Gilead , which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
in 2013 , the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and took possession of laboratory work , which said Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the Gilead medicines .
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the United States supported the entire control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokesman on Friday .
according to the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently comb@@ ating the city .
they have released more than 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are undertaking clean @-@ up jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband , an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ mption T@@ ables ; the former Foreign Minister announced an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice presi@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations over the past ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp conce@@ als behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US Pres@@ idential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the announcement of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to post something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions in terms of wealth , his donations for charitable organisations , his business deal@@ ings and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp asks to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the topic during a speech on the Economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tru@@ mp on a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clinton &apos;s tax declaration of 2015 showed that these are just USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ ac , fire@@ work body promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion together with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
prior to that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World telep@@ hon@@ y dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom he@@ ats up with a b@@ ang and spra@@ yed fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
a last chance is a thro@@ wer , who shoots a gold fire unit into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
city council decided unanim@@ ously : no new ki@@ osk on St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of tra@@ des@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - especially the retail trade in the core city - are considered to be significantly expanding .
however , the city council now unanim@@ ously refused the request for the new construction of a sal@@ es@@ man at the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally we welcome new business owners , but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director de@@ parts Berliner &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israel &apos;s election as there would have been Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country code list .
the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ?
attributed to Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director contacted the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the election will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large amount of resonance on the Internet where people called the whole affair a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged calls of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in a different way that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not include in the Quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police uses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they assembled to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to insert rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters encountered Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators entered the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies take up existing ties with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran climbed by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade expansion was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian representatives were around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as and Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
search for witnesses : beverage market falling into forest fires
a rob@@ bery @-@ raid was perpet@@ rated on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under guar@@ dians of a fire@@ arm three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces from the drink em@@ ark@@ in demanded the publication of cash and then pl@@ ung@@ ed at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ Golf .
the police did not share how much money was captured .
the offen@@ ders should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fled by the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ bery , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day @-@ group / social group work of the Nag@@ old child protection association with their supervis@@ ors on their summer @-@ free time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker .
in the quietly situated leisure centre Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ essel with the visit of the string zoo .
to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning .
kids and coaches were treated with their own cour@@ get@@ tes , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was used to create beautiful jewelry from beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of the return home the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ ting @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were tac@@ kled together .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all mini@@ stran@@ ts , the St. Anna Conference of Ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were tested and finally decided to go to the B@@ ish@@ ops City of Freiburg , where , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the opened gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ sh@@ ole , and Hei@@ ligen@@ ried , went on the way .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and informed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a minster of Our Lady is standing , and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s path was taken off by the Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made R@@ ast to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights , the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were at your disposal .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller arrange for a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
on top of that , one entered the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but had to climb around 500 metres altitude at first and then get out again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg cathedral later in the afternoon and passed through the doors of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
at the evening Mass in Münster , the min@@ is arrived at the destination by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home as Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ined last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ ump made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to take home a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Gary &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner played a Olympic race in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the Ki@@ wi won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was slightly behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , when going down in a higher gear , to slow him down and to allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der announced that he dropped off on the track after a weak start .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
for such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ ds said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int next , which will start today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ ds said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification as function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team is relying on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
in the background , dram@@ as played in the background , the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of magn@@ itu@@ des such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if one looks at the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of Port@@ land melt @-@ sm@@ el@@ ting due to the lifting of the energy yield question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus raise all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria &apos;s earlier this year to give no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy , fixed for 20 years , runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered in a closure .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects as the melting plant consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa close the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , most recently , due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium mel@@ ee with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , stated that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the facility will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expecting a dis@@ mis@@ sal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not imp@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have been in effect from November this year even if it is yet another explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic situation of the branch before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and a capacity of around 900 MW of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; power market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator that would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a das@@ h of reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the car@@ th@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , spotted reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é affair of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris needed to let her other girl participate somehow in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for Vo@@ gue &apos;s cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on top of it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most popular issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles a visual band rather than a fashion journal , the issue attracted a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertisement from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are model@@ ed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls below the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like success to everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ tes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to travel around on the ver@@ mouth seems to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she is selling pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centers assign 16@@ 0.000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s relief cor@@ rid@@ ors are ann@@ ul@@ led every year by the community centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of other short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ im@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already busy at full capacity , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l Municip@@ ality Centre said that the last survey of the National Association of Common Law centres revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Common Market Centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families going through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dischar@@ ged un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will shor@@ ten the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Chancellor of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can obtain the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of allegedly pulling weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign leader for North Carolina was shooting a fire@@ arm on one employee , while she was traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i agreed to have been waiting for months that the matter would be settled internally before it realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four others had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had ri@@ pped his words out of the context and that he would not turn to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) significant losses are recorded for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this revealed representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin .
the SPD , however , would be the strongest party in both German states and would have had good chances of continuing to position the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .

Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia communic@@ ator came to market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good either .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y .
initially , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies at high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro fans can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months before at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west @-@ pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , even when agon@@ izing slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could imagine in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; phone boo@@ ths experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is dominated by vendors who came to Nokia much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s winning stre@@ ak began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Bul@@ let , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of extending He@@ a@@ throw is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ end on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers each asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn in natural growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and across the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented run@@ ways .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad block@@ age
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age are equal to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that his desktop page would change coding for his advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and Her battle between the time @-@ grab@@ bing open source community and the b@@ yst@@ anders have been in progress since the invention of scor@@ ec@@ ards , &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lo@@ aders have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company has set up ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertisement on your desktop PC accounts for a large amount of revenue so that Facebook &apos;s investment of such a step appears to be worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ bloc would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we instead focus on development tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman suspected of suicide on Swiss Highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 wanted to kill himself , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who call this and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers are not accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ e@@ woman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder after she ski@@ pped and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the judgment .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have demonstrated similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 density atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , inher@@ ently similar atmosphere yet slowly spinning .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; during the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rot@@ ational rotation of Venus is expos@@ ing its day @-@ to @-@ day side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planet explor@@ ers .
although it was originally inhabited , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
their oceans were evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus carbon model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season , Roy has won the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tracks with the Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to the remuneration for North Sea workers will be suspended , while all parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution of the current strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start next year in order to address the problems anew .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its counter@@ s in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 % reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ adi@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ escope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates below the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary evolution .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now rotating the quick@@ est .
at peak rotation rates , these po@@ ison@@ ous stars meet large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star , by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars rotate more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still much ahead of us about what we want to learn more about how , when and why stars will slow down their rotation rates and impose their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; rotation rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the main stat@@ s .
nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the resting @-@ hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have forbidden stero@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis Sc@@ andal , he was locked up for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered as the prime suspect to have been receiving high @-@ performance funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said sweet@@ ly at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days do not run no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az with act@@ ress and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy @-@ grab@@ s of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e &apos;s arch @-@ ri@@ vals Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want a @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : the X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland could not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an experienced athlete would have won almost one medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing incidents have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier @-@ runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court , CA@@ S , confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) filed an application for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news was le@@ aking about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went by himself into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be a dietary supplement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the forbidden substance should be the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation may not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z , tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the former clubs in China were also cat@@ ered for fierce debates among the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun was positively tested for the Stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in the Chinese championships , but had to wait for a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially inj@@ ected ran@@ som is much higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as after archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end code code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is on the game with private users , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the use areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain to their victims by chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , direct access to accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for free sample files .
and become private people after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly bar@@ gain hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data back un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and mand@@ ates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment will be made per certified computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte survey are confident that ran@@ som@@ ware can be used to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful disclosure , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damages , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetrators could hen@@ ce@@ forth take entirely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block @-@ mounted heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ator then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit upper part falls down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l in case of folding back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat bench of the rear bench can be folded up like kin@@ ks and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor up to ceilings .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions .
however , he should do his job a bit more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasant .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security system belongs to the City emergency braking assistant ( operates at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant operates very reliably .
and the intelligent speed sensor responds to traffic signs recognition and rot@@ ates the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI bus@@ hing are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standards .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is only conceivable with hazards that are typical for air traffic , the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee pad during the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline no longer had to pay compensation to the man .
illness : when pays the organis@@ er
after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is without any doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than 10 percent of the guests have reported the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ able case , the second day of her vac@@ ancy rate was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
the holi@@ day@@ makers returned to a faulty sewage treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip had been lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before leaving the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no contamination was found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and sch@@ ism .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , however , this increases the safety and strength of the people &apos;s consent for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit range over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be re@@ pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapons law must be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the endanger@@ ing of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers better social care to be necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior was clearly opposed to action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ stick for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problemati@@ cal .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid what you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green Chief Simone Peter accused the Minister of simul@@ ating crime and ability to act with new anti @-@ terrorist packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet slo@@ gans and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay are no longer safe for people in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the Autobahn feeder
it regularly st@@ alls on the circum@@ navigation street - here is a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the right @-@ hand bend is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding street every evening when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße , the right downhill lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic con@@ forms early on , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder makes the driver nervous above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ log reaches to the bridge over the Alber@@ t@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt some three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge could no longer have the necessary load capacity to take in two lanes , especially heavy @-@ duty transport .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected daily traffic will continue , the responsible state company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the right @-@ hand bend , the state enterprise deliberately chose the faint @-@ hearted period during the school holidays because of disability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traffic will be passed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge theater are planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students between 11 and 15 years attended the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the youngsters of the class had come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from tongues , and the Young Theatre will work together in the next season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for the improvement of weather
the weather has taken the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a das@@ h of the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said Friday morning .
our hope is on the night of Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ schu@@ ppen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is per@@ sei@@ den , which is one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have their name because they appear to come out of the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems manifest or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , board member of the German Society for S@@ leep Talk and S@@ leep Medicine .
but what one understands for the time is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ation and a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
just when sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Haus@@ physician association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind these are organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medications .
in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc may be ill , wake up every two or three hours and begin to think about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and be affected the day should go to the doctor , she advises her .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes .
among other things , treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is hardly ever present in Germany .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should first contact the family doctor , she advises her .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with breathing problems , in case of path@@ ological daily fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etz explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just make no n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ oning , one goes to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling traces the sleeping end .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
it counts on : regular bed@@ - and standing @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , stop drinking alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Kurz@@ circuit World Championships in Doh@@ a and simultaneously presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle full of 150@@ ,000 Euro , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveying system in the swimming sport is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; anyone who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; asks the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream .
airport : ban@@ de arrest arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in taking two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage @-@ ste@@ els as gangs .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs , civil servants in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf airport again recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen of past theft of theft .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men have committed several crimes and have worked together in a collaborative , collaborative and particularly professional manner .
the experts of the crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts specifically to the thi@@ eves who had been specifically admitted to Germany to commit crimes .
in total , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between yet another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look so at first glance , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed onto the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , are favor@@ ed in the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly Berlin &apos;s interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ a@@ for@@ ge , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , the building workers are renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers removed from the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents go for walks with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are primarily anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted to meet several hundred police prot@@ esters on the left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police put up between home squ@@ at@@ ters and their neighbors , does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which , even today compared with the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , many houses were occupied by the former GDR , including almost all the Main@@ zer Strasse very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : residents of GDR times and former home squ@@ at@@ ters are now sharing their Kie@@ z .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on disc@@ arded discs or newly painted fac@@ ades , which have been thrown with coloured bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned in the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left @-@ autonomous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours regards this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences like body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the offen@@ ders make obj@@ ections , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house near the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they don &apos;t have been .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga city anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
this is why it was so important that the residents returned to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are finally con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so good are staying here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot afford violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are anno@@ yed with colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
anyone who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pub area , can complain about noise there .

it is mainly about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes , as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to bear the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Board of Directors to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work so far , so it is necessary to rely on private apartments such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communal dwell@@ ings need to be established as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent stay there are intern@@ s , apprentices@@ hips , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be m@@ apped or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; people who are nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always possible to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did they fear ra@@ dic@@ alization after the most recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ tised .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins will take them away completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , main and honorary officials have to look for activities on @-@ site and in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this context , they always have in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid .
actually , it &apos;s unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the origin@@ als are already busy to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
