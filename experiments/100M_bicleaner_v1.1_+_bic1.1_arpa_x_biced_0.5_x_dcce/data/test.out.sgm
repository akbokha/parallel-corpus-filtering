<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are at odds with tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and cautions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will turn regulators back heavily, and he is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "that is why taxes for the rich would increase," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical aplicit wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could be party internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "on the other hand, Clinton wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazid trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rise, then he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who at least wants to demand of the rich wants them to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report entire five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm for me seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness demonstrated that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara that Russia fell in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger, since it was done by a supposed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuild the cousins is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state controlled media performed a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious, allegations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed by a failed coup d "état in almost his office last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Travel operators and charter companies will be relieved in Russia if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti stipulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there lang, tomatoes here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the persistent resentment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin's snail pace - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders." two countries that break from the West and feel bad and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey broke off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "IVANOV has been part of Putin's closest vote of confidence for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transportation Opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin, Putin is said to have ordered" "" "the dismissal Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been Vice President since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was the director of the management and staff of the registrant.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the government's main task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once promoted as a potential President, once again wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin to be quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated item - one could almost say - entrenched posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia since a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally by Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensland crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which is approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown presented a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck at its place and the final section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first clasp represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap in the north or the country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very cheerful activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heaviest, as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they embed only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then videogames and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for videogames in the 1990s (later it created a animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand dropped in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS, and once they have been found, they can be "captured" (using a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an app for Apple Watch who pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train each day for 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes of time" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "" "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elike." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumpy toys, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has occurred a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track down our activity earlier, they did not give us a reason to play sports, as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">She awaited a final test in Brazil, a competition which did not go so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in one of the deadliest attacks of Phoenix in one of the deadliest attacks have been killed in the car and listened to music in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding in extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, shared that requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the village of Tangipahoa had claimed ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it was raining in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels after the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.</seg>

<seg id="13">The river Tickfav, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still beheaded people from flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued close to Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose strongly overnight.</seg>

<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flood had" "" "spread quickly" "", "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that authorities considered evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer was reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground had been fully weighed down by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities gave an indication that heavy rain and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tangipahoa Parish and a lesson in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The WWL CBS subsidiary reported that a co-ordinate in Tangipahoa also attacked 200 houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches that were now both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the commune of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals that were rinsed from the flood.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's olympieship in the gymnasium and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising winner of the Olympic Games and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterly gynectics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastic classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic partnership will only have four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality is such that gymnastics are a more expensive sport and gymnasts first and foremost in private trainers who are maintained for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as you wish.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is a tedious and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have free and affordable Harlem gymnasts for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which make it possible to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of Girl Power through the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance doctors who voted for election refused him.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "in July, Hunt plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a" "" "No Man's Land" "" "and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance doctors are expected to receive a new contract, which contains changes to bedside and weekend shifts in order to improve the maintenance of the clock.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairwoman of the BMA committee for assistance doctors announced last night in a message with: "assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular, that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by discussions prompted the government to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional time, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holiday and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The coagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty tissue in the artery walls that form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot causing the flow of blood to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the bloodstream and clogging the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons already having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca by British company and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former member of the cabinet, Sir Eric Pickles, verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and local government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of election cabs to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should lead a card to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "at the moment, a voter must only call his name and address." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable inks to a person's finger when they release their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "it demands that the press should have more access to congregational documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups." ""</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur was to be relieved after a litany on corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>

<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm for the fraudulent letterpress - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including guiding ID to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as evidence has been added that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video by Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you're approaching from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and go out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker flees from pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, keep the weight on your weapon and beat the attacker on your chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subjected his immune system and litters of a serious test - by dragging some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his train on a euro note, a railings at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the leak of each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of dumping the rinse button of a pulling toilet which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to rinsing pots of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said," "" "As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he met his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after her Luminometry number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Milky Products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that's the worst thing I've done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming, which ended up saying" "" "Lass call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him, just like the eceldy Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these filthy treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left her social apartment after a delogization with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had clear holes, wooden floorboards were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer able to repair.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who in the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, disputes and floods included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, wooden floorboards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to be invoked regularly by the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogierte them and her partner forcibly by the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to freely withdraw.</seg>

<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will offer comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "until the end of the summer holidays the country's election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupid than now it's not about: summer holidays, heat and land wrestling - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during vacations, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up votes are just arduous to apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the electoral and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD intersects and what remains in the end of coalition-proof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees off his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spreading roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary wormless predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, seafering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel is blaming the blame on the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create this" "" "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale talks; Angela Merkel is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel at once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeast CDU renounces the usual election conditions on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this means coking, play only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country you are brushing the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly there in the vastness of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the advice of the CDU-campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing:" "" "they have to go where it hurt, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called out its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 per cent behind CDU (25) and just slightly ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "in the election of 2011, the SPD was still clearly gaining 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the Parliament." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and transfer their electoral campaign largely to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "", "calls the president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "otherwise, green campaigners embark on a search for local voters on their holidays." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, curvt straight with a houseboat through the lakes of Mecklenburg and also finds it beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some significant complaints there," "" "says Florian King, responsible for the technical management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachstitutes highway, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were seeking and more familiar with their navigation than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increased the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that now the road is open to customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales outbreaks can be seen through every one you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt on a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, answered with the hint that the restaurant benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now they must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other county districts, where things have been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all collages Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less frequently passing by because of complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot go down, it is also nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his stem cell comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 works on its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its host in its long-term history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hasten the comment section to suspend it under the pseudonym Nonallotsam's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to middlelife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a plate are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wild gestuliere before I stop, hold my hands and say something like that: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, dem ich von Sister Ray (Number of Number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already treasure," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are set to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I conducted, people usually have gotten rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in adherents to the plate revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to focus on mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flutes from a record pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I leafed through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came just recently here and said:" "" "I don't own record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-rich.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of newest synthesizer- and sexpacked pop instead of experimental jazz in the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but serious psychological trauma is hard to imagine when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running in business for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more of a window shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the appearance of muting the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research revealed that the results of YouGov agree, they can be ignored, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who overlooks unaware of middle-aged middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to store 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which have a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary establishments, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" "" "absolutely comprehensible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that the food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closure" "" "for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed blades: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>

<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans according to time, driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">The UK's impressive performance during the 7-day rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in handling, side quilting, backrest, line run, and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, a 15-man team would have been beaten in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for the UK - but it will probably not be that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused GBs to bounce off fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau frolicked in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">After four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right hand, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hissing Tackle of Mitchell stopped the hill from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it just stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jasa Veremalua in the right corner down a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou squeezed through another weak Tacklings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB conducted basic changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an experiment for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sultan, whose fans sang, flags flew and danced at the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fijis rang, the fijis hugged and GB crammed in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scarce semi-finalist match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more vocal gold than in these games and that will mean something hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes until the last 220 tough Hieve, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though they were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympics in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who put such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated bet, which is likewise unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was an assistant than the coach, who did not know thirty months ago, if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes slightly the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-free and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened by green power are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing systems for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing old seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors, from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speaking and organizing, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a chorus is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs don't get out of the box too fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people evokes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-fallen men deceive themselves on long recumbent events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also demands a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and more alert than myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who hears when a sound comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">This is the best way to change, may you be rich and continue to help others. |</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of friends sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a chorus, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who had complained after a doping-lock right in front of the games, was mercilessly thrown out at her start (100 meters breast).</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bizarre scene: with a raised smile she was still standing in the hall and had provoked her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was established that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a Jubelstorm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many more sportsmen who go to the Olympic Games in Rio, despite the Doping past.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel / USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked twice because of doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion runs even faster than before, it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel / Jamaica): the two-time Olympic champion and seven-fold world champion had to wait for a six month lock in 2010 after having demonstrated the use of the Oxycodon pain.</seg>
<seg id="15">After having had strong toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (discus / Croatia): in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European championship was tested positive for the banned Stimulans drug Methylhexanamine from 2010 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic denied the sentencing and was locked for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The four furthest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favoritin.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel / USA): the Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and has been locked for 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">A means of penis enlargement has been responsible, beamed Merritt.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (Hammerthrow, Belarus): probably hardly any athlete was recognized as many medals afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone-doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">The meanwhile 40-year-old had to give Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championships because of testosterone abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the CAS International Sports Court.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 80.04 m he is ranked second in the world rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20 km Going, China): the world record artist and Goldfavitin was tested positive only in May, but may still start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the 29-year-old world championship there were evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the blockage of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was milder and ran off on 13 July.</seg>

<seg id="5">From the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, also Austrian citizens are still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this regard, the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as waste.</seg>
<seg id="7">About 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, Hua Hin exploded two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, and a further person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation near the popular beach resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed before the Revier of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, some detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast required several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was said that there was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," "" "said Army General Danai Kritviavee Freitag ahead of journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves to possible motives - however, it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited territories and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "the authorities in the past few days would have received secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed of the exact time and places." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Still unclear which group was hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police found their officers all over the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they do not address tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the bombastic bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.</seg>

<seg id="30">"" "" "" "after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary journeys to these provinces." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution that was held by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military considerable influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves toward stability, an improvement of the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is dedicated to restoring the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed at a stop at a popular Hindu-shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest stop in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>

<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani provided media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 metres of free-style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired frenetically at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a volatile calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household by the district council Kulmbach found that for these sewage installations, underlies were opened.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the systems in a cost-efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As head of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage installations of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, there are also over- or undercaps from the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious increase in revenue in all three sewage installations by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the amount of wastewater generated in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past calculation period in all three plants, not least due to their age, refurbishment and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that in the sewage plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welschahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground and after almost 20 years, the first sewage treatment plant had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "these extraordinary expenses have resulted in the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same goes for electricity costs, which are still clearly below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water case in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance" "" "fully smashed" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="21">According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility company cannot be extended by these systems because they are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticises</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, proprietary tools that generate more than 30 million more selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps are open to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past when they were accused of promoting blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics named it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shook that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company apologized: the filter was designed as a homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalls the filter to vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Savapani, a Korean-American student of art whose tweet has been widely used across the photos, that the filter was "vulnerable and told uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the dewarting extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "if one of Snapchats Filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was earlier," "" "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete their Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site, reported a report of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces, intelligence service committees and the military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically detectable by high-ranking CentCom commanders, regularly posted a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command's press releases, statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom Andant publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Centcom's investigations are ongoing by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessive process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking democrat in the Committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "corrupted the morality among analysts and" "" "gave too little space for deviating opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence to have found any evidence of intervening in the White House at the CentCom analyst on a" "" "specific political opinion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported cases of investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who received complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "the investigations have an impact on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critics concerning the secret information on the Islamic State recall interrelations of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writing piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time left to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there were no significant effects on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive appraisal of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of them will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game starts on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the wristwatch to the swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on your TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a black swarm with dimples, could certainly have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he is a swimmer, turner or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline turret.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, in part in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make a modest argument for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse the last 16 years that many who had questioned I did not know that it is an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 it had been an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has some outsiders, partly because it sounds appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending upbeat - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring skiers jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and ointtos) before landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official schedule of the Olympic programme, you will be judged according to the performance, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medalists have to go to gold in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further highlight in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympia-ord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel weary when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the acquiring and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan community following air.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security professionals strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, notably in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, whereby dissidents are effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or pushed into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have other options except protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum TesHome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this fragile, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which have been forced more or less in recent years, would exploit the turbulence and be able to arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of delusion under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones became more and more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies who hide where they reside.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they had gathered so much protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, prospered mainly Christian high-countries, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was his prime minister until his death on a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in recognizing early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, apparently prosecuted by the government and then stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months, and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronsky flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his statement Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by attacking that his repeatedly repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together its fellow-strikers, who seek to take it in protection during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump restled with regards to the allegation on Thursday, and in interviews he insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Trump while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign for falling survey values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump had already given sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism of himself when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained, "Of course, I meant sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries of politics and then return to demand.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I also believe he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump assumed an even more etched tone, as his survey values continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general seeks not to excuse his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he increasingly focuses his attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocally his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent intercessions, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political commentaries" "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioning Mr. Trumps's statement whether Mr Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind legs, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton has served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread themselves by allowing them to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of getting around on each of his words and being taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's excuse as just a further proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bigoted café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash which had no Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue store have been supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But when New York is changing, it is also a re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, used a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garniches like capers and sucked onions.</seg>

<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive trees while Coe, 57, Truthahn with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">As the reporter questioned Hackney, this found the couple matching a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>

<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks are born only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this lifestyle, embossed by slowness, seems to be a bulwark for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at least from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, comments this lifespan that is a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist guessed for a long time that Greenland sharks become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion sensed them when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt for sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadaver, which tortilise from higher water-layers downward.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of animals, they analysed the lenticular core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the protein contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons scan increased large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres, the lentil nucleus has a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their core nucleus, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland-shark, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold to sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland-haie with the increase obviously is at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates too.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalises live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the old record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon neck on the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal feeds heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of the mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," "" "says the evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media watch after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israel's election as there would have been Arab guests according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies take up existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to get access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports climbed by 91.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran climbed by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachting-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were tackled together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministrants, the St. Anna Conference of Ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were tested and finally decided to go to the Bishops City of Freiburg, where, during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the opened gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigershole, and Heiligenried, went on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and informed the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a minster of Our Lady is standing, and so the pilgrim's path was taken off by the Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches always made Rast to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, the parishes of the local parishes were at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller arrange for a tasty and starchy dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, one entered the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to climb around 500 metres altitude at first and then get out again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg on the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis met at the Freiburg cathedral later in the afternoon and passed through the doors of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening Mass in Münster, the minis arrived at the destination by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner rained last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Jump made the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gary's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinds, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner played a Olympic race in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the Kiwi won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was slightly behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, when going down in a higher gear, to slow him down and to allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph at the Kenny and Hoys side, Hinder announced that he dropped off on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">For such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinds said," "" "It feels like all the UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint next, which will start today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinds said:" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification as functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relying on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background, dramas played in the background, the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and mobbbing allegations as well as the retirement of magnitudes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if one looks at the first evening of competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations by workers - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus raise all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria's earlier this year to give no further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy, fixed for 20 years, runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to domino effects as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa close the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium melee with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, stated that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the facility will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL also said that the contracts were called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in "expecting a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to melt" "" "does not impair." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have been in effect from November this year even if it is yet another explanation why it resigned from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estée Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the carthhians-like?), spotted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz-uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché affair of almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris needed to let her other girl participate somehow in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as for Vogue's cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on top of it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most popular issue of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a visual band rather than a fashion journal, the issue attracted a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertisement from the 832 pages of the tome).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover-star is expected so eagerly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years, more" "" "celebrities" "", "which are modeled as" "" "Models, the celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of her generation - falls below the earlier category, she is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even though everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the mistlettes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to travel around on the vermouth seems to pass at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>

<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have demonstrated similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, inherently similar atmosphere yet slowly spinning.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the GISS model simulation, the slow rotational rotation of Venus is exposing its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was originally inhabited, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in what connection the rotational periods are associated with planetary evolution.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland could not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An experienced athlete would have won almost one medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping incidents have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier-runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critical athletics competitions, these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court, CAS, confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) filed an application for the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigations" "", "quoted Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news was leaking about the positive test at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went by himself into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be a dietary supplement," "" "declared the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the forbidden substance should be the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test should have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported his criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "" "was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, like his brother Tomasz, tested positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, the case Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association had prohibited the entire Russian squad except for systematic doping, but also the Läufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the former clubs in China were also catered for fierce debates among the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware protection specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially injected ransom is much higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebyte chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as after archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end code code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is on the game with private users, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the use areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, direct access to accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And become private people after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly bargain hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then search for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and mandates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment will be made per certified computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Malwarebyte survey are confident that ransomware can be used to repel ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful disclosure, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price escalations," "" "explains Malwarebyte chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damages, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could henceforth take entirely new targets on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a block-mounted heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear, it doesn't work in any place.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions.</seg>

<seg id="19">The security system belongs to the City emergency braking assistant (operates at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>

<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant operates very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed sensor responds to traffic signs recognition and rotates the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI bushing are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far before the wake-up ringing no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems manifest or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeks, board member of the German Society for Sleep Talk and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what one understands for the time is the insomnia, i.e. an inhalation and a sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just when sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Hausphysician association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind these are organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in a depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc may be ill, wake up every two or three hours and begin to think about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and be affected the day should go to the doctor, she advises her.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, is hardly ever present in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first contact the family doctor, she advises her.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he took gold for the first time at the Kurzcircuit World Championships in Doha and simultaneously presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has now protected himself from his ex-team-mates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 €bonus and a jungle full of 150,000 Euro, nobody should be surprised about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveying system in the swimming sport is bad, but doping controls are very good.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between yet another cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look so at first glance, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes on playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed onto the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "" "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are favored in the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly Berlin's interior senator Henkel has spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go-zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadaforge, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, patrolling out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the building workers are renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers removed from the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents go for walks with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are primarily annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wanted to meet several hundred police protesters on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police put up between home squatters and their neighbors, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which, even today compared with the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied by the former GDR, including almost all the Mainzer Strasse very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: residents of GDR times and former home squatters are now sharing their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on discarded discs or newly painted facades, which have been thrown with coloured bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned in the words" "" "Left-autonomous Violence" "" "this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours regards this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: criminal offences like body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offenders make objections, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house near the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they don't have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga city anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the residents returned to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are finally condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so good are staying here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot afford violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed with colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group Refugees, Administration, Government and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-cutting wool milder, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant some - less mocking than on the variety of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative assistant with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an ice-cutting rug of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central part, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is mainly about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes, as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations have to bear the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Board of Directors to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far, so it is necessary to rely on private apartments such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communal dwellings need to be established as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent stay there are interns, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be mapped or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "not employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problem cases, says customer honestly, "people who are nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always possible to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did they fear radicalization after the most recent occurrences, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says clearly," "" "what some naive might call" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins will take them away completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, main and honorary officials have to look for activities on-site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "in this context, they always have in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach." ""</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it's unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the originals are already busy to integrate the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
