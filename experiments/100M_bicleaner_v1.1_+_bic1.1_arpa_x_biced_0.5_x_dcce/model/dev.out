Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution that was being discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement building and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by Barack Obama &apos;s deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , which was partially considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend , is accused of having shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told a somewhat z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said that the family contacted the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who studied in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ ra@@ ged him .
one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ l died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police found lam@@ bs later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friendship Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar play .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues played .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ l when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for several companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica qu@@ ill in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of anything wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , initiated the first semester program and specialised in American ab@@ original and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the guard , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb had the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ l as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and I think that I &apos;m a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a length of the arm to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey figures showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a break .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bush Super PAC@@ s and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ can saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa confirmed last week that 60 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temp@@ er as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tended to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l had the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 per cent think that he did not have the personality in order to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their v@@ ows , Republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp is real .
when asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since when four of ten at the end of July put their money on every bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination over only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters watch Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ ap@@ points the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say to never change the mind .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as frequent as Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep critical His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the new @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration matters .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do so .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can Congress , 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish ver@@ anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea @-@ watt .
in the street , one square metre of a that@@ ched roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular locations one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square metres prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two double pe@@ ppers in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller ble@@ w the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympia &apos;s Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it was running .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their tak@@ e@@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third race .
in his 28th consecutive hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership , Müller received good aid from Olympic @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a f@@ uss @-@ thought shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ess had promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich played word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also stum@@ bled on Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but in their offensive ende@@ a@@ vors , they were often over@@ power@@ less .
the attacks were often initiated by a player reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field on the left upper side of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storm Ide@@ a Brown hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by a direct debit , the goal keeper Roberto was perf@@ ected with his knee ( 34 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians preferred to play the dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to put needle stit@@ ches .
but on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , he was aband@@ on@@ ment .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ill with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MEP Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the defeated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Go@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller took another one on it .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavarian fans in their audience block evidently the supporters of Pi@@ ra@@ eus had prov@@ oked with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and preceded the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : when ren@@ oun@@ cing , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are dental c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ising the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could , however , last for more than ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to the age of old according to our findings .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ates the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remain@@ ders from the late antique period
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
during all construction projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always considered to be a specialist office for archae@@ ology .
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now found five .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , which belonged to the church .
young woman from a freight train

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its function , corresponds significantly to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to develop with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new capital court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the parties involved agreed among themselves to arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work towards an International Investment Court .
there could , for example , be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice which can enforce the tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all by the fact that they are not supposed to apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ ined ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission has taken into account important issues in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Unit , Business@@ Europe , warned against restric@@ ting the economic situation of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership Agre@@ ements ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement was supposed to stand at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the shy @-@ looking fol@@ ks@@ crew recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks about various places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens is proving to be a wonderful creative person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published in 2003 and the third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that nest@@ le harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted at any time into great opul@@ ent opul@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a daring series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine River already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared and breaks down positively . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic replacement parts .
this sixth record studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is anticipated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question of tension
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s round of questions and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre @-@ defined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony celebrating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several pages stories in newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes suggest to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chair of David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will have both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dispute with ad@@ jun@@ ctions and instead committed to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , is represented if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues may occasionally seize the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of an &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and thanks far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound grew le@@ aps forward to data indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller building target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % following the takeover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .

shares of Glen@@ core climbed 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company R@@ ating auf &quot; sell . &quot;

the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato hil@@ t idea
potatoes or ton@@ er ?
both - and in the Kartoffel@@ keller , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ h owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes rather than D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue grill in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now changed to the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
there , according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay therefore does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also with its customers , the culinary understanding comes well .
Met@@ cash ki@@ cks ground support campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a contin@@ gency campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ ner S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will cut some five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will be in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , spoke at a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects operating debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ests and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to enhance sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products every week and to deliver a better selection of private label food for the improvement of their stores .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs at El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always called &quot; Special C@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious struggle of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka could have hit Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp ble@@ w up a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am very proud about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had any problem with the other players he is trained hard , he &apos;s good in form , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take Kyr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday and it describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has quickly made the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to go illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with ou@@ trage .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian front police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return while more and more from Macedonia and Greece were arriving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels not to agree on common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a direct action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency stand rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used to build the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not refugees seeking protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of offen@@ ding criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are fast to repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and pressed a crowd to push there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton has now support 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ er elections .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among men has decreased mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders only res@@ ides here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic elec@@ tors under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about it .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the legi@@ bility are also quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the Vice @-@ President throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see it in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic voters are asked for the election who would be their second election for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den doesn &apos;t decide to run for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters watch Clinton as candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call on the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters will be considered unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters did not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions relating to H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister will continue to be satisfied , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not been affected altogether .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on the general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nationwide also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good grades for guidance .
Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off from the six tested candidates .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before the Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at a car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , dividing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Stu@@ dents
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became power@@ less and were supposed to wait an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ sils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of persecution and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to only blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or un@@ official - this is why we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its belonging to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a rise in interest comes , and the domestic will fall into bankrupt@@ cy , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
for this reason , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank emphasized so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could find out that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a interest rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that capital investments will be di@@ gest@@ ed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend in the past 35 years - approximately 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return over the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which published Bob Dol@@ l , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on the stock starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the rate of interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year on a rise in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights were put into the shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond markets fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yield between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tension has wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
large and large companies will profit from the larger part of their business in the United States , benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt become worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest are most likely to lose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts are of different opinions , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station because of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argues that he is increasingly incapable of distingu@@ ishing from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the broadcast The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , claiming a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ caster to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ caster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitor when it comes to live music and education .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 is nowhere else to learn about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think also important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder was needed to engage the audience when it did so in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sports came under fire to tre@@ ad commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s the next time an entertainment series star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from roy@@ alties for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the expenses in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started working with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing turnover .
experts believe buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times watched the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from buying purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending was spent over £ 1 online .
some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , are now carried out more than one third of purchases via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burial places in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia de@@ compos@@ es the collapse in some of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ned , largely dressed in white , the distance to pay their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ vesti@@ a cemetery .
the procession passed at the holy place , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , hung up a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 be@@ ers who were killed , when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Massi@@ f of Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mek@@ ka with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the business abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the big mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the h@@ addle who later takes place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ elled the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the sovereign family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , are opened
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that British are laying down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the chain chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
this is why King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and closing 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are taken by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying items by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed on the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and revenues after the group owed the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will have 200 new stores open .
A@@ ich / D@@ ob &apos;s function@@ aries because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ warding education on Wednesday at Kla@@ gen@@ furt .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 had funds from the association accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions for private purposes .
he def@@ ends the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also accused of financial mel@@ tdown .
this fact was the chair of the Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represented that the association was not created at any point in time .
the sports officials had only charged expenses and the sports club , for which they had spent a lot of time and money from 1982 until 2011 , and in 2001 , the Passi@@ va beg@@ ged some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 € ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we lead the club further or lock ourselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bread@@ cru@@ iser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money , our life insurance policies are safe at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the receipt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , you are not allowed to do any debt .
furthermore , in case of financial success , reimbur@@ sement of the allowance damages had been retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore also l@@ ump and not detail entries appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the proceedings .
the accounts and savings accounts managed the two def@@ endants , the second def@@ endant said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial services , it is important that only the freedom of the debt has been , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigating off@@ ences , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account was based on the name of the second def@@ endant , and according to this statement , it was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he said , after all , he thought that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , Ju@@ dge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a c@@ ents salary , he just calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
on diets , he was charged 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the accused were not able to show exact documentation for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operating audit , in which everything had been judged correctly .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ endant .
all the exercises were carried out in cash , so that he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard scores another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the number of staff cuts running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will expand further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions of the US computer terri@@ ers He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved by the company on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall in the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees .
listed below were the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard shares 2.3 percent .
the company generated by printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .

sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues declined in 15 from 16 quarters .
HP responds to changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting up and massive pit@@ falls .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more stores online .

conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly come up with rejection : 54 percent talked about it , 35 percent said appro@@ v@@ ingly .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : peak of violence in Hungarian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wer against several hundred displaced refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind them a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water laun@@ cher .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set off the spray spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sag@@ ged in themselves and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the Serbian police spokesman also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
the world is observed when the US Federal Reserve is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reuters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero @-@ area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , leading staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ omy outlook on global conditions .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death shock at Delta State University &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left an excuse for exc@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague and killed his colleague - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he had shot at someone , and someone killed him .
lamb told the staff of the emergency center that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he did not give him .
there was no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ l , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ emen moved him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ l had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ l had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ l was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as polic@@ emen picked him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University as his life lu@@ ke@@ warm on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 managers around the world will cost the work@@ station of the Group .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is to contribute to a contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no management board in the future for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the board of managing director Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement rules for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit hopes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will result as quickly as possible to viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision the pilots are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to weeping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double score and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will take , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an i@@ vory tower .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very sorry about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposedly describing the plot of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is willing to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the curious , trees , Th@@ need kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , buck@@ led creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row before a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England chose for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ right victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared to results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination where - and I told this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago you would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not deliver so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X factor Cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but of course it depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin punch and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t do anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not finish his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns right away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is a back @-@ up sp@@ inner in the Ka@@ der , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful action into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy to heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could win Zul@@ u if the economy up to 2017 in a noisy machine
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ exploited new negotiating strategy to hold Great Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was viol@@ ently viol@@ ated for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on their own debt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disturbing contractual changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European friend , who wishes a great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also an ex@@ iting force .
Poland could soon have a nationalist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not provide helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign is 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ or@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his crazy , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ shaking foreign nationals and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly strike on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time needed for me - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today .
it can take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I press it friendly - in development .
he says we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ anded tendency and the wil@@ dest realms of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus can say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege business , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be all point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I recalled on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze public health report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) have joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expected that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Product ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of p@@ he participated .
the Group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence is evi@@ den@@ ced and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ward , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the radio charge should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , probably seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in contact with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as wide support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , admitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am proud to see how this should be public @-@ law television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence at the hunt for reviews was &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ day@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
in the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value from this .
of course , you all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , educate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial channels alliances to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
nem@@ ato@@ des usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani realized they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the reinforced ultras@@ onic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the wort cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones wear TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ oun@@ ds to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of the light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be sent down to the desired location in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissue un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and subway trains , requiring a second look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from September 15 to 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read the type of DL@@ R line that turns into an image of a tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in September a s@@ warm of weapons dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the fair .
the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ Pack of Allen key codes that claim that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will be critical and try to bring political work to the public outside galleries .
many artists work with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms trade - by a Le@@ erst@@ elle of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the intru@@ sion with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the fair comes from the area within the Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors spark@@ ed fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order from the US Army on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot by the shoulder . &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance to student halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely terri@@ fying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ baths , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were set on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people attract and their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student homes form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos refu@@ elling : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with baking .
since you start the Uni at the high point of Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you knock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steal food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the dairy propriet@@ or .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors whether it would make them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more lau@@ re@@ ous music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she broke her own music , shut down her door and went on to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , to turn to her , to separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves up all common friends .
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stun@@ t is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never forget one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds holiday homes for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the educ@@ ating mother and the less servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushed to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough living space over the next few decades .
a completely different , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I took my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the adjusting regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
there is only a lack of space in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not true .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is it : in the past five years we had a boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments which could hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the servant of the poor .
I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well @-@ built today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the adjusting app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may be the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able due to the merging of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton only a motto : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second accentu@@ ated the decisive seven overseas races ahead of the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Br@@ ite won seven of the twelve races of the season and took the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .
for days a mist bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ cruci@@ fixi@@ on 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which President Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot apply the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; will be seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness to the spa town .
district office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ino@@ ft have put together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new start point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consulting , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the inner city .
more specifically to the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the health and care insurance companies .
for years , we have established with our ambul@@ atory care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood as the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ino@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular convi@@ vial ambi@@ ance . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 am .

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang , 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the artist &apos;s house left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as was said in the programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but he also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Form@@ ing .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in Vienna Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the court stor@@ med out of the shop , insul@@ ted the civil servant and accused her of the fake fine of the feet , as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bremen , one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow will be displayed , or not .

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young people and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home now .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and there was demonstr@@ atively passing by .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured before the building went to smoke a cigarette .
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a hammer , one put on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
only a v@@ ague part description is available so far .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen &apos;s practice .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , physicians - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he has invested € 3@@ 10@@ 000 into the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ eren , who currently completes their training in the Ver@@ den hospital and will also want to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of breaking @-@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle themselves as house doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50,000 euros is given by the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding program of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ Rhin@@ eland Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gong , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen each quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another clinic practice .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , she would have gone .
by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation will also continue to look in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the fel@@ lows .
with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly has already felt it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients as often as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pushed myself from gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum request can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the care and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even not via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia wanted to continue to travel to Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister pointed out , Slovenia will not be able to shut down its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees had already tried in the hours of the night to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country has about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was necessary to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with some 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id had arrived in the morning , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been around 500 kilometers away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border crossing Serbia throughout the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could , in fact , come to a slightly further west section for observers already predicted by the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country , as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wedn@@ es@@ days at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high refugee numbers at present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn up by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .
exchanges h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having provided insight into still un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der businesses should have been made to the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years

&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big pla@@ ques each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was attentive to her 20 @-@ year anniversary with this action and is quite often confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce help is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well for questions and talks like the volunteer workers .
while some pass@@ ant spontaneously attacks the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long &quot; , others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action on itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical Plant Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
however , it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , but in the end it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped people to open up .

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and delivering gi@@ ants has lowered his profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 per cent and effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ging transports of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to the growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to € 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the bo@@ d@@ ging transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labor costs in freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States lies im@@ pending on them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey sitting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two@@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ising the US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the close @-@ to @-@ zero current interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to keep waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is in@@ secure in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted this week &apos;s interest rate .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that further growth is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial posted an average of 21.@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would settle the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
another month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence would be expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was continually below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , and Dow is now around 10 % lower than May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when one should increase the interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would be able to attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Federal Reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the last few years .
the mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , ple@@ dged to raise interest rates in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to lower their Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a serious crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest rate , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the engagement of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , it is quite different from other classes than at a real school .
Brazilian pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS seeks to educate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative impact on the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ key building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously lowered without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the Board of Directors approved an application for a legislative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ es first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roof@@ top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was again a roof ti@@ lt which for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the a@@ version of the roof - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municip@@ ality usually dict@@ ates to liber@@ ating requests rather restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is no recur@@ rent project in the hall construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs of approx . 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and width sports promotion .
in the next stage of the proceedings , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Board of Directors for inspection .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this is the supervisory board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further inside station .
the rooms are available .
employees who can &apos;t go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff are informed of the plans .
the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year , is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a dis@@ semination of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years Fischer is supposed to work with his team if the Supervisory Board has agreed to appro@@ ve both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , is to be permanently closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
the Coun@@ cill@@ or , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , argued that the House , which is owned by the Federal Government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psych@@ i@@ atri@@ cs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ dun@@ ov with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were used , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
after a shot of fire , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could lead to the accident was unclear at first .

a crime suspect has led the police to the funeral of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a non @-@ violent crime .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday .
as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man was also arrested on Tuesday evening , according to the fact that the investig@@ ator was reported to be the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having not come home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially found personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the mis@@ fortun@@ es , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the local authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the police that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward on Wednesday to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter , the investig@@ ators put his death on him .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing space
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year .
thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers registered in the last year .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting up a budget deficit that will grow bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , approximately 77@@ 0.000 residential units were already missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many people lived in large cities and were forced to live in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much longer because of the noisy on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should stimulate the social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed dwell@@ ings will be suspended for a limited period of time .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee housing in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been sum@@ mon@@ ed .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free funding : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no passage to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slov@@ ene Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the eradic@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , also necess@@ itated proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
the border strip poses other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , after the closure of the border , hardly any refugees come after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before closing the door on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws represent the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were met in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit @-@ ons &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier gri@@ ds were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the bor@@ der@@ line was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still stayed in the country after government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were occupied after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the rush of refugees , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ ered the edges together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first covered the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a pleasure for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers shifted from one ICE into a regional train towards Passa@@ u in order to try again after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try over the border .
but the regional train was shut down in front of the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday , on the first a double brid@@ ging run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent more z@@ ig@@ s to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the creation of structures to ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has put an emphasis on the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guiding these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic states in the border areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the close winter to make decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof districts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the refugee reception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to provide quarters for thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Rec@@ ept@@ ance Centre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the state govern@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him , even for the refugees coming in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , it &apos;s good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier today critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that districts have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holders or size of the so@@ bri@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was more successful in placing an accommodation , he founded Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is its most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the republic as they themselves declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the search for the neighborhood has not been successful yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since people are currently unable to accommodate these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism exer@@ ted the chief of the city on the division of refugees inside the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has taken over the further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for now , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , the fact that Austria again introduces controls to its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is drawn up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the new ship@@ yard , and later also to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter remaining area in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags stand at the centre of the new shop .
in fact Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade . finally , she gained new growth in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets starting at 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
prior to that , several weeks were re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location , on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
for me most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women come into rap@@ ture when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is recycled every outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are named investors .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ters .
whether he expresses himself xen@@ opho@@ bia , journalists or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy revealed - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ refresh@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related to him over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , alongside Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also at word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in high German : the don@@ ors , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was New York &apos;s first real estate purchases .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State at which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was he@@ wn without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked to Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the building of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so like@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement fores@@ ees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so crum@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ we@@ et@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts how many K@@ all@@ ten@@ stad@@ ters mention that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ t@@ inger Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , interviewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie @-@ singers , even in the USA , the interest is w@@ aking up .
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in the reviews for Today .
the N@@ ine Breakfast Show was aired by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , put in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of the Executive Board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , in recent months , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August , Today , Today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are al@@ right , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may be un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparently who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will surely not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you might have accidentally added a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are not , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought it was throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserved for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose if not she , she was enig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on 10 a.m. on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m .

Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ki as it did with the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to get a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Hay@@ ne also strengthened himself publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game .

it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian run@@ way with weapons of arms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of F@@ W fall arrest in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there were not correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get classi@@ fications in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Day Ques@@ tion of Free voters will take place until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , very different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it gave during the Yugoslavia Wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers wish to post@@ p@@ one free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum compla@@ ining : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need federal standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps away , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long @-@ term permanent torch remains the order of the day : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Medium Level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools where an extension of the secondary middle level was tested by three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums wishing to do so .
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

in the US , the Dow Jones Index accounted for about 1 per cent in the increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock exchanges reck@@ on that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the great decline in the fut@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the RW@@ E &apos;s shares to a record low and left its mark on E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the top of the Da@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors gave the German chip gro@@ wer a bit of attention .
investment in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold more than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of the Daimler and BMW cars rose by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets to Nepal prot@@ esters
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ Ã ber@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , chief district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of whom cast stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber missi@@ les .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been ruled by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the site at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be re@@ buil@@ ded .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market an area of about 4,000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the terrain for a mix of trade , trade and living .
you are waiting for corresponding offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Big Road , already a few months ago bought and the buildings which are located on it .
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor first presented publicly plans for the project .
a number of investors are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure facility
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , di@@ mmed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are located on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective customer , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has been in discussion for months about ten to twelve million euros .
intense reactions among marine @-@ owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details about the hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member in the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , he fears , like several other project critics , that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would greatly increase : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus@@ ses have to come so that this counts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches dup@@ licate donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ation call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / could be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid training - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was dissolved only by one percent and partly at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood levels that reflect the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater levels of BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and more likely to complete the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of severely disabled people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent a obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is indeed admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must reflect on how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he took power , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under twelve years who swallow hard alcohol dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , thus the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers report from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how adolescents drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , very few spra@@ ys can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities believe that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the promised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ atter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

odo@@ urs : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the ho@@ ops stand on a bad place , but that he will turn it again .
Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA because of alleg@@ ations of N@@ eil@@ son and be cau@@ tious about January new commitments that could destroy the unit &apos;s unit
D@@ ons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now with five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need really the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January transfers
despite his comments , only a few weeks ago , which indicated that he split a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new additions and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ target person Mich@@ u with trac@@ er
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the decline of Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA @-@ battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was lifted later - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity asked , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s executive board has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline in the playing field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen has desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points in front of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team who won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the security personnel could not be satisfied , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and stayed in custody first .
why I will be witn@@ essing an ec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew nearer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the entire story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she admitted that she could have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot pret@@ end to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
persu@@ aded man after a wet police ch@@ ase to get out of the c@@ anning river
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he sp@@ ake the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tactic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threaten to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity and asser@@ ted that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cobal@@ t trial in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held for 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had posted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com stating that the integration department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I am going to appoint - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should I think that it will be personally ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the frustr@@ ations of the trainer have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ently viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been the same yesterday , which was also the case .
but it was also on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy back against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations of ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the NR@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the storm players &quot; Ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ling of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring@@ ing , when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided for us the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny as it always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the match Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not give any points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the final round at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin at the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ ans with a $ 200,000 b@@ ail on drugs charges
a man , possibly a lifel@@ ong penalty , threatened to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the stat@@ ely statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports on the police daily and stops at an exit block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
a truck driver was severely injured during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate to the left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
the cab of the accident @-@ causing damage is completely torn apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
the result was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when he fell asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ solic@@ ited pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confused messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused were using computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , viol@@ ated the conditions and not to appear before court to a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence attorney Gregory S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custody on account of hear@@ ings of other cases pending .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgement date .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany from small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many traffi@@ ckers left the people on smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees were taken up in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dust @-@ guns on the German side .
there they are received by federal police and rel@@ a@@ yed to the registration .
in comparison to the weekly start on Wednesday , more refugees met again at Munich Central Station in comparison to the weekly start of the week .
some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8@@ am , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm fires in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who in recent days moved from the Bermuda Islands to the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in Lake Constance with bows of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is especially important to keep track of the compact car that is currently selling particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by force @-@ driving forces ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new premium cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel introduces a entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the Hessen also offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are among the first time ever .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door car .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version .
in the trade it comes early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan dealers want to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is the manufacturer &apos;s specifications with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers were mainly on the front part of the front : the radi@@ ator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated in Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new versions , such as the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the Law of Justice of Justice , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim to receive financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this is what the Federal Constitutional Court decided in a resolution published on Wednesday .
the persons affected may even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe . he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , is now on the free foot , has been transferred to a larger cell .
his office of office due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and returned it back to the trial .
you see the man &apos;s dignity wounded .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation , an equ@@ ation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chamber court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must now clarify the amount of compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they spoke only in April to a prisoner of compensation because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged for three months from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also entered the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours of aggres@@ siveness , even for drow@@ sin@@ ess because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information provided by the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young academ@@ ics , 19 are to be dropped off in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic but above all in paid rentals : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments have to be created per year , and the federal government would have to invest some 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year .
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry farmers in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of labor for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers from up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation that asylum seekers are confined to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , also because of shortage of skilled workers , there is a majority of the view that refugees should be made possible faster access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge .
to date , there is still no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses .
research also shows that workplaces are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creation of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the Royal Road for Work Integration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ es , estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example by allowing more specialized schools .
in the countries , students without German knowledge will be prepared in welcome classes on classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ an from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any services after the asylum seekers performance law , when they start studying .
in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this gap shor@@ tens to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , challenge Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization who took care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
duties are also part of the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to leave such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , pushing the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender E@@ quality Act since a decade .
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U murder series has shown that the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the stak@@ eholder groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are committed must become reality in the coming years if the country is to stay peaceful and its new citizens want to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees so far , says Dr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money is required to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand over all the nec@@ essi@@ ties at the registration of health cards .
rendered services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cast off as many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers law prescri@@ bes .
otherwise , the doctors first of all make the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants become worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in doctors &quot; sur@@ geri@@ es , interpreting costs would need to be taken over .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee camps , there are clearly more untreated obstruc@@ tions , and in the youth it is about HIV @-@ enligh@@ tenment .
but with the partially other symptoms of disease , German doctors would come from their training , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the medical angel , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly put out tests again .
according to estimates by the Bundes@@ Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and death threats .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration disturbances , strong fri@@ ctions and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , an early treatment would be necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal @-@ dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the family thus lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Mor@@ ales also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to loose the Cuban duo loos@@ ely .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with your intuition and jo@@ in@@ eness .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst says , &quot; Is it not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read by the eyes as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go to the arena .
the highest bid : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so for every visitor there is something to be there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sam@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with repentance .
last month they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story , his involvement in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return right in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to get a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are going forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , judging by the Richter scale of 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has pulled the apprenticeship out of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven away from the distant hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ve the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , focusing on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deeply .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty near Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football coaching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often with@@ hold back to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing told me , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say Hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning until the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also needs a strong start against Swedish masters , since they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 deci@@ de@@ dly in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who was taken over PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat &apos;s passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the net .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , appeared at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some defects and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after the re@@ boot of Cav@@ ani .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shot that was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored the sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö was able to return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ away from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result down before replacement @-@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core g@@ athers $ 2.5 billion by buying stock
the mining Ri@@ ese Glen@@ core resident in Switzerland , which is affected by the collapse of raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday by a share sale as part of its huge debt plan .
the company registered in London , Glen@@ core , stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange on trading on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core last week announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper , and other commodity prices dropped by 20 to 40 percent .

XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before returning to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europe champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just before the Spanish Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who was playing for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Pok@@ al winner , four times Champions League winner , two times champion league , twice champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won &apos;t win anything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s victory triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives on a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the filling of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian fes@@ tiv@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they deal with the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white col@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights at the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was aired , the Social Media explo@@ ded in front of dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter posted nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against color .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million with home .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the ar@@ du@@ ous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he did not finish the course at all , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will get the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment on it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb in one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of each game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has slept well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good from the bull@@ pen , saw clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh Inn , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ yle to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who caught a two @-@ run from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen introduced the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth city , the Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been d@@ ashed before the game from the injury list after he had been missing for more than one month due to a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first one , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE on the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not beat well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the throw school .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is expected to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the infrin@@ gement list to start against the wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden r@@ ushed on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ hauptstadt were prepared for this eventu@@ ality in the last days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in Hessen who were responsible for the first acquisition of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gi@@ essen in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he designed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister for Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary , nobody will be sent back now .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
they did not name concrete figures and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee trade in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany too .

Hungary closed its 175 km long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to shut down the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut fence .

Raum@@ son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the moon sw@@ ings easily on its path around the ring plan@@ ks .
this deaf movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is written in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time it was known that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .

R@@ ama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 1860 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must abst@@ ain from Rev@@ ital@@ ised Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor &apos;s injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think about now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy , sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy however : in them contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus supports visual power , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell .
the peel colour alone says nothing about how ripe fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special note .
it mi@@ tig@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney suits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first F@@ öh@@ n@@ ado , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ erhof , the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday , the f@@ öhn blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the F@@ öh@@ nt@@ eler .
after gro@@ aning on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest flow .
on the north side of the Alps the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the F@@ öh@@ nt@@ valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance into the adjoining Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even Or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dri@@ er for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the edge of the Alps .
here the rain stops , which stops until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps must be accounted for in the next 48 hours with some over 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after big rainf@@ all has already fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning , the f@@ öhn blows out , in which a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind refres@@ hes well until stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live their faith in the city of the pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a for@@ ego@@ ing sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses about the ab@@ dic@@ ation .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has taken a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that address topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ dding or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his theological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the relevant Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant master of the ruling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened once with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ vise this , perhaps to carry me back to the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to restore art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterised today by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the pictures , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture seeks its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday when presenting the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Scriptures in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious topics for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn close
plans have been made , companies commissioned to model earth hills for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finished .
failures in politics and administration cared for dr@@ one , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railroad .
so hill scre@@ ened , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first woman in the community Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is setting a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet there the Minister of State Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Federation therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; says K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals place a clear sign when they will carry on the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports leader Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , no one can om@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can make soccer league , no , we need to use our bla@@ sting force , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their locations was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses one eye in case of accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the US , after midnight he fell on a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then retired to the street - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we met before the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully able to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and continue with the software companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ mish ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he therefore comes as little as reserve drivers for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend as much as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs. K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : den@@ si@@ ties in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have finally sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training session on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high loading of its pros , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his stem from the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change on the door@@ keepers position .
that &apos;s why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem @-@ keeper Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all Europe @-@ league games , however , he left Tu@@ ck@@ les open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement of team@@ mates R@@ eus that the final trigger for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , middle @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl respects : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot au@@ tos : government wants to lead Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
on Wednesday in Frankfurt Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke about a &quot; new mobility era &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy change@@ over to digital radio stations .
a test track at the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use it internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic could be at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dus@@ sel@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will only open in singles from 25 September to 4 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ List in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant !
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look frigh@@ tening thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is a good luck that the designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely surviving work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , which has been used for much effort : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list has been hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich , 14 tons of material .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were produced in a large quantity for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
that alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ eh@@ ouses .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a major role , then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stal@@ ks , is an increasing order potential .
those who don &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
we already make half of all orders with us .
together with nine other companies , Mo@@ eh@@ enge P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they can wear the protected label .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
in the Asian region , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper and almost exclusively sold via chains .
moreover , the export , currently in Russia and the USA , is weak@@ ening .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outdoor table of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies which must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball .
at some places the machine ticks small chi@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith masters in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a memory .
thus I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a new film , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical little girl girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already standing : Rob Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wide for the world
the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should seek to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population milking system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also make controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to offer consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve pal@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is present in the EU &apos;s working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large predat@@ ors , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that on the basis of the still existing limit values , about 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available .
according to Food@@ watch , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram in return for this loos@@ ening .
Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low charged that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is heavily enriched over the food chain especially in predat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can be caused especially in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry stated on his homepage with regard to the current maximum values but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
