Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the Te@@ hr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by Barack Obama &apos;s deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can Congress , which was partially considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had been rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor asks to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacted the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cr@@ ot@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no evidence that Lamb , who worked in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police at Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ l died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problemati@@ cal behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested Lamb added a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner methane .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , teaching geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doc@@ torate in Ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ cs in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency cry Lamb said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ st Night at night 5th September saw for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica qu@@ ill in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , initiated the first semester program and specialised in American ab@@ origins and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb had the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress call referred to Pr@@ enti@@ l as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal employees as last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the 2014 Christmas season , 45@@ ,000 workers have been hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies prepare to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I &apos;m a simulated paraly@@ sis and an arm length of it to be with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be scre@@ ened on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN chief calls again on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the UK and France - at the Minist@@ erial Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey figures show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won even a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ s and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s staying power and start r@@ ushing their dollars to pl@@ unge him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a transi@@ ent phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy mid June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ can saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans had a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters are happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages approximately the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 per cent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 per cent think that he does not have the personality to execute effectively his position , and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put up their g@@ uts , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since four of the ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination vis @-@ à @-@ vis only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P voters are looking at Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans were gathering another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted at the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp harv@@ ests the majority support .
he ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have made their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say that you never change your mind .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competitor at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp had called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a turning point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep critical His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the new @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration matters .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems to do Donald Tru@@ mp as well .
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive resi@@ dences of Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea watt .
in the street , one square meter of a re@@ building house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular locations one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living places , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and i@@ dol
two double tor@@ ches in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller pav@@ ing the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it was running .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern in the witch @-@ chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their tak@@ e@@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28th 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola is finally going to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ event@@ h to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received the aid of Olympi@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his 28 hits in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership , who made a f@@ uss of the world champion remembered as a f@@ lange .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm scored in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a concentrated and committed introduction without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the top league , including against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they courage@@ ously ran , but in their aggressive efforts they were often over@@ power@@ less .
the attacks were often preceded by a game shift to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was luck@@ ier when his flan@@ k collap@@ sed from the right half @-@ field on the left upper square .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ a Brown beat the pol@@ o of Poles from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct assumption , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians pulled up their habit@@ ual game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle @-@ bull .
but on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ance .
for instance , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ a over the Latin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a square with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to do something else is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the Rwand@@ an Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller put one on it .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavarian fans in their audience block evidently had prov@@ oked the followers of the hosts of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least a Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke not only hurt the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : ren@@ oun@@ cement decreases the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to reach 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss include cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the gin@@ gi@@ va , high@@ lighting the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ising the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could reduce their risk but within a short period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good teeth health up to the old age .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble across Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains of the late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new bou@@ levard for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
during all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is regularly added as a specialist department for archaeological soil conservation .
arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 tom@@ bs , which belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functionality corresponds significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced assistance .
by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is set to rise with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
for the first time there is a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the parties agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commenting on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Appe@@ al .
there could , for example , be resolved disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , demanded especially by large corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tiz@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel judicial system , which allows companies to collect damages from tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws , or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is mainly critic@@ ised that they are not supposed to apply for the trade agreement negotiated with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission has taken into consideration key issues in the reform that Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association business Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
originally a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting fol@@ ks@@ eller recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ lian and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person .
with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; published in 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; sounds elegantly composed songs , nest@@ ling harmon@@ i@@ ously to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ or has it that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a daring series : each of the 50 US states should be obe@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and breaks down positively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
they live with guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , who lives in New York , returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a widely celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 .
over@@ shad@@ owed with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no list of records of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens works on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic offset .
this sixth regular studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but performed by sequences or beats and plays with every effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs recently desc@@ ended , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle from Ne@@ on fron@@ tage bands and big lumin@@ ous stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the glo@@ omy Hamburg restaurant More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly attracted St@@ ev@@ ens rever@@ ts back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group plays excell@@ ently through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the audience hears that the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only at an en@@ core thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bly , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows in ro@@ aring applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gment .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six pre @-@ defined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported it as a guide .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes plan to remove the whole idea of limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to $ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy set , says he has &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subject to &quot; comb@@ at@@ ants &quot; and the dispute with bar@@ b@@ arians and instead committed to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Ministry of Economic Affairs , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also spoke about the idea that other colleagues would occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of an &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy theatre &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the part of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound grew volati@@ le according to data showing a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest and most advanced assessment of the time of interest increase since 2009 .
the Po@@ und rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % following the takeover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competition @-@ group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
the latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Glen@@ core climbed 5 % after the mining company said that he took 2.5 billion $ through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % after the sport lending company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages are endanger@@ ing the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster presents Lebanese to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or pat@@ rons ?
both are possible - in the potato dig@@ ger , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ist Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement poster , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes rather than D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on television by chance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a grill sk@@ e@@ wer is spinning in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese has meanwhile been registered at the Munich Patent Office .
there , according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason , it does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches ground @-@ level campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - incident
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branches from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food vendors and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A shops and shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts paid to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost around $ 13 million in cash from interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will drop sales in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ cal@@ ash &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction while pressure on revenues and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ests and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to counter@@ act selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and offering a better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholesale dealer will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent temp@@ est around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves more than criticism for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is often referred to as &quot; Special C@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious engagement of St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ting , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp ble@@ w up a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite jeal@@ ous about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little bit into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adap@@ ts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has quickly made the climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his action .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , with@@ draws refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a man &apos;s land and charged Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a land strip at the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
when a police helicopter ho@@ ver over them , the migrants cried out &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian Stand@@ ing Police .
some reported food and water protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations Block at a meeting in Brussels on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency standing on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , allowing them to block streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having completed a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most coming economic refugees who are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence made by the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament must still agree on the use of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Mr Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of perpet@@ rating criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd in order to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination nation@@ ally , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the voters in the elections .
more than five months before the elections , most of the democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders only returns with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about it .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the voters in the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and di@@ bility are also cited .
since the Vice @-@ President throws a potential for the presi@@ dency , 57 percent of the voters want to see it in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second election for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors has emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the important features of voters in the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den best cuts off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in general , democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in line with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs continue to be placed , most of the Democratic voters of the primary elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinion altogether .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among the registered voters overall : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp still receive good grades for guidance .
among the six candidates who were tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush would best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches the nationwide survey close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son finds himself in the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support grows 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted in front of Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the lowest level , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest pol@@ l by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
with a look at a car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holi@@ day@@ makers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even rises to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a sham@@ eful ritual of a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft grab@@ bed Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the Brotherhood &apos;s national president to seek advice , said Poli@@ mark@@ edly Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unter @-@ force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a prosecution for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of malicious attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organisation that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ official - this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes and the house is shaking , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
for this reason , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus when it starts to increase interest rates but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find out that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rate increase .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historical trends with a view to how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be stran@@ gled between 12 and 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in up@@ swing - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return over the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob Dol@@ l , CEO of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , released at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on the shares begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
what is most remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the company &apos;s 118 interest rate levels have only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; if this is different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants all year round on a rise in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade will only have a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with an increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were put into the shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is quicker than with shares when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , yields appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , however , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tension has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
large and large companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt become po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest are most likely to lose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure equity games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains due to higher earnings , even if experts in different opinions are , how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ caster to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ Director of the BBC reported the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies far from its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , argued that tough@@ er was needed to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for the purposes of com@@ mitting commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sts that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the revenue chan@@ gers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
last month there was the lowest result since the recording began in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the expenditure in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oming and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall spending in August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that happens , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers pushed around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites sli@@ pped off .
experts believe that Black Friday , at which the buyer fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium revealed that £ 5 pounds was spent a little over £ 1 £ online .
some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , are now being carried out more than a third of the purchases via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at crane accidents - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially de@@ compos@@ es the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s great mosque .
mour@@ ning crowded , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay their respect as the first of the dead arrived their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the procession passed by the Holy Place where only days before a crane ran through the mosque &apos;s ceiling and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were approved for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the family bin Laden because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , hung up a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual meeting in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch goes on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week sal@@ man was told to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the add@@ ch , which later takes place this month .
the bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also critici@@ zed the group for not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project run by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ruled that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , are opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you apparently belong to a minority .
the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
so King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were taken by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions about purchasing items by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed at the top of a British FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and revenues after the group owed the cost of closing stores .
because of the trend King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will have 200 new stores open .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president A@@ ich / D@@ ob had to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion at the Kla@@ gen@@ furt regional court on Wednesday .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 had funds from the club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
he estimates the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also accused of financial mel@@ tdown .
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in addition to the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was not an asset to the association at any time .
the sports function@@ aries had only charged premi@@ ums and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of the debt - the Passi@@ va beg@@ ru@@ ed approximately 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread@@ board of the large audi@@ tor of the financial institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have bul@@ lied money , our life insurance policies were safe at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , you can only do no debt .
furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the compensation of expense compensation had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump and not detail entries appeared , the former chairman explained the operations .
the accounts and dic@@ tion@@ aries managed the two def@@ endants , the second accused said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the payments have not been disclosed to the club in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial services , it is important to have the debt free , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when , in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigating off@@ ences , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account was based on the name of the second def@@ endant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repar@@ ation compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why damage compensation ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first accused stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the Society had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the official said he never paid a cent salary , he just calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he added to the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ endants were not able to instruc@@ t accurate records for the early years .
these were no longer stored after an operating audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ endant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
all the exercises were done in cash , so that he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard scores another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the current loss of human resources for three years , the computer terri@@ ese will break down further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions in the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ ese He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to cut 25,000 to 30.000 positions in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall in the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock remained 2.3 percent .
the company , which grew up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently out@@ dated : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led even more in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be recorded on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ appointing PC market as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after his services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the latest .
sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acts that customers are increasingly purchasing smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more stores online .
altogether , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total of 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in hos@@ ti@@ lities in Iraq , however , was mainly due to rejection : 54 per cent were talking about it , 35 percent said appro@@ v@@ ingly .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are on the other hand , to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be .
29 per cent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wer against several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the limit control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police line was formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water@@ shed .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to officials .
the officials initially inter@@ cep@@ ted pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas has been spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now been waiting a little withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sw@@ ung together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ men suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .

the world is observed when the US Federal Reserve is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the most important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for nearly a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view , was that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was on zero .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and launch a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rugged outlook on global conditions .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
death Shar@@ p at the Delta State University left an ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague in the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he had shot someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency center that police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ l also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ l was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said Lamb had called up relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
as polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb was awarded a doc@@ torate by the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his lu@@ ke@@ warm on the university website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building up the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
in 150 of the 1000 managers around the world , the restructuring of the Group will cost the work@@ station .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa Cargo re@@ builds its corporate structure and utili@@ zes the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is to contribute a contribution of around € 500 million a year out of cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer any executive board in the future for the passenger business .
the low @-@ cost airline German@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
in the future , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been a complex undertaking .
the airlines registered under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike .
this divided the union .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement rules for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , cockpit hopes to come to viable results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that Lufthansa is out@@ sour@@ ced to the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this made the left foreign def@@ enders to cry and shut him out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play this season again .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had fallen into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg score and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red card and the suspension of an i@@ vory tower .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ ze Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very sorry about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost ni@@ mb@@ ly .
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead gives a content indication of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ or @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ or @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the curious , trees , th@@ under stri@@ ck@@ ing Once @-@ ler , a ho@@ vering , pur@@ r @-@ like creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row before a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ tro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali has developed as a Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves England &apos;s test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared to results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , he would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Hei@@ son got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England was first depos@@ iting Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a drummer that I set up high .
he is an X factor Cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not finish his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my earlier te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns right away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has done some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a championship coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh breeze even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .

the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = going out of the UK from the EU ) could gain momentum when the economy w@@ akes up by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y , &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour and the TU@@ C , which was fierce on Tuesday because of Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , as deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on their own debt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disturbing contractual changes that they usually do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb at the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants a looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance races like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a consu@@ l force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not provide helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign is 2017 to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the refer@@ endu@@ ms inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can recall Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist , who has made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his cra@@ z@@ iness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but set out that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never mis@@ led him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I press it in a friendly way - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ef@@ ish @-@ colored trend and the wild realms of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ femin@@ ism can say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , aber kein Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy sc@@ outs in him did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow law was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father sought to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties according to all the reports on their convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ able bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a ne@@ sting site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ity about Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Review &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic public health principle is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expected that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Product ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line from p@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ aring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have served as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking lowers the national health system two billion pounds per year .
by suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcasting fees should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs probably seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fees , which I do not consider medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a prime time window , because they want to reach as wide support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programme is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er is another , admitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I want to see how this is meant to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was to blame for valu@@ ations &quot; due to the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue when they go on their hypo@@ critical missions to justify £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call on you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of us think that for 150 £ a year you get a great deal , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to &quot; educate , educate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , clearing up and entertaining them on public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to issue the partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels to make alliances to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are being be@@ amed with sound effects .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on motor on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the reinforced ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the lit@@ ters .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultras@@ onic on the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ bli@@ sters and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of the light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissue un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; important notice : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September in the font types of the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line that turns into an image of a tank .

the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works non @-@ profit with graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a lead of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the Ein@@ blu@@ ff with bright colors and animation it stays stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within the Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where Ex@@ hibit@@ ors are showing fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ty , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were set on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people dress themselves and wash their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student homes form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is tired of convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes by che@@ eks .
since you start the Uni on the high point of Back Man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked them something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say they serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it would make them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded to this with even more lau@@ re@@ ous music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep for two hours before they broke their own music , shut down their door and went on to their three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ ys@@ mal embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , get rid of them , separate themselves and see them every day and perhaps witness how they pass through all common friends .
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot fellow resident is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his non @-@ closed room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good sweep is fun , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety by hiding - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced row houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for instance for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the single mother and the low @-@ income servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and good build today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be forced on the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds up town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we also need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have legally passed my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking regulations always make it particularly complicated .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but are you not ag@@ grav@@ ating the competition for affordable housing ?
in the past five years we have been building boom in Germany , but we have built luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the educ@@ ative mother or the low @-@ income servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and good build today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone Operating System when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the software update is missing .
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait for either to wait until the attack returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able due to the modification of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile making sure your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch off half way and this might result in a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto in the fight for World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup runner @-@ up under@@ lined the start to the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in front of the race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and also tac@@ kled the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by President Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot get the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; will be seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ s office is looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ino@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have gathered under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the health and care insur@@ ers .
for years , we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are an infinite number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too often many benefits of the insur@@ ances are not taken into account , because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a business director for the elderly and for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both executives particularly in the demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and in their familiar environment as soon as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 a.@@ m .

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years of age
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the artist &apos;s house left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was stated in the programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after World War II .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Form@@ ing .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in Vienna Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

men beating up 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people , and struck them with their fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ fall and bleeding heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ ased to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed several times there .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the wounded went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the help of a mol@@ dy pitch , one put on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
until now , only a v@@ ague part description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters large .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller to take over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ Reinhard and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen &apos;s practice .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places on the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a renovation phase Müller opens the office again on 12 October , until then he has invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ kat who is currently completing their professional training in the Ver@@ den hospital and will also want to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ eck and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and volunte@@ ered to be involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of breaking @-@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared from September 19 .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ bacher is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ kat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaker room .
in addition , the E@@ DP is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 euros is given by the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ ner @-@ Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ kat every quarter , about 2000 patients arrive in the field of Fel@@ den@@ ce@@ ausen , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another clinic practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
if no successor was found , she would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk also continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the rock stages .
with their farewell , an era ends at A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors have practi@@ sed for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ th@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly they already feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients as often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pushed myself out of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum request can also &quot; naturally &quot; do this .
the care and security of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is weighing &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave the refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia is intensi@@ fying the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ in will not be able to abri@@ dged his borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees would have tried to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could use them in the nearby maize fields .
according to local media , police vehicles are constantly arriving in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik with new refugees .
it concerns predominantly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country has about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied however that it was it that people began to propose specific routes : &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said .
according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id had arrived in the morning , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been around 500 kilometers away from Serbia all night long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west section .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the fall of refugees in the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then , the EU partners have consistently shown the country a good record concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried Wednesday morning to calm down at a local alarm in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high refugee figures at present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing land cards to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn into Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still un@@ cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

with the information captured , insi@@ der transactions are to be made on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot;

most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce for Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lot of operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .

they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ all life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big tables each with the head@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce atten@@ tively drew attention to its 20 years of existence and is at all confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistant is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well for questions and talks like the volunteers .
while some people spontaneously attack the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long &quot; , others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that eventually the end of this world will come to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which is working together with the Car@@ it@@ ans Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to publicly announce themselves to the tables is understandable , but after all it is a very personal matter .
the theme of death and death is still associated with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped people to open up .

the death and funeral atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with the subject by personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce responded by the call of volunteers , she immediately reported and was there when it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce St. Vincent .
they are all well trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another wart , keep it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
every two years , training for new employees is offered .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Luther@@ an Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there other personal requests can be recorded on post@@ cards .

the lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ders of heavy and large packages , which will be le@@ vi@@ ed from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result was increased compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipments , which resulted in sales in unit Express shipments to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
sales in Bodden rose by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for nearly a decade .
threatening above them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story sitting hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising the US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be compensated by the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ term short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is growing solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fearful to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to maintain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led in itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg predicted an increase in interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that further growth is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial posted an average of 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would settle the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
another month ago , the F@@ ed was on track to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints from liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the proposition was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was continually under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and need it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month , after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was more than 16 % below its peak in May , when investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , while the Dow is now around 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Federal Reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion led to confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ac@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on the financial market movements that seem to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
varnish , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses for a rate of interest , cited statements in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia prompted the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate of interest because markets are getting upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that changes , I don &apos;t think it should ha@@ sten the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 L@@ ess@@ ens .
every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , it is completely different from teaching than at a proper school .
Brazilian pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is in a sho@@ cking way to educate women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the plant@@ ings for the long @-@ awaited hall building at the Bern@@ ina sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent meeting of the council , the elaborate construction proposal was unanim@@ ously sealed without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the Board of Directors approved an application for a legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central first and roof super@@ structure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof ti@@ lt - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally more restric@@ tive when it comes to freedom of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
though gymnas@@ tics is not a recurring project , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are approximately 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude promotion .
in the next stage of the procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall now is presented to the Board of Directors for inspection .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the start@@ ling plans of the hospital GmbH of the district , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the deadline will be postpon@@ ed on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should reloc@@ ate to Sch@@ ong@@ au with f@@ ishers and the further inside station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who can &apos;t go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change is initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a dis@@ semination of the offer in the area of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years Fischer will be working with his team if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ship , which has more than 35 beds , is to be permanently closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
in the future , Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , ru@@ mo@@ urs that the House , which is owned by the Federal Government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I complete this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer said about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

hunting event with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
after a shot of fire , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could lead to the accident was unclear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds who were missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a non @-@ violent crime .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday .
as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also captured on Tuesday evening , is considered to be prosec@@ uted and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having not come home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for a young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the susp@@ ects , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities reported to the police that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old were killed and the cor@@ pse was put in the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward on Wednesday to the fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put the charges on him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no translations available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing shortage
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution conflicts on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Socialist apartment building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
there@@ with 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then b@@ ump into the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for the last year .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the study also makes significant savings in housing policy in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is pushing for a budget deficit that will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , some 77@@ 0.000 dwell@@ ings have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many people employed in large cities were forced to live in flat share rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er Wohnungs@@ bau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction .
thus , the basic income tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed dwell@@ ings will be suspended .
in addition , the alliance needs attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options .
the funding programme for refugees shel@@ ters by the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , on Monday evening , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the currently available 300 million euros have been sum@@ mon@@ ed .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia mend corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no more passage to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with Slovenia &apos;s neighbouring country on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slov@@ ene Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the sc@@ ot@@ ting of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , coming into force on the same day , also render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of them originate from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
the refugees did not meet at the border fence on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border barely any more refugees come .
on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before closing the door on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws will step up the overcoming and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ uns as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentences ranging from prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country threaten the convic@@ ted .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were met in the newly established &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stopped there .
practically no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers have begun to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier gri@@ ds were disman@@ tled and one of the recei@@ pts in the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to speak at the end of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still stayed in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by orders of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein the end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red over the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we left the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stra@@ ined train passengers embark@@ ed on a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to try again after the announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still cross the border .
but the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending more z@@ ig@@ nia to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to build structures that guarantee humanity , our German Chancellor has officially and public@@ ally moved the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ ume of National Socialism .
not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions .
the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; promised land , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter , to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has filled all hands with the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Konrad is used to his word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad had already got a grip on the chaos in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reception centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have no longer homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has had talks with the provincial governor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him of creating quarters for the refugees to come . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum coordinator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; places in the ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that districts len@@ ders have to meet a certain height of the tow@@ ing holders or the size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful in housing , he founded Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asive is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the republic , as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own neighborhood search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with approval .
Linz calls for better distribution
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for refugees are planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected are currently unable to take these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , other locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief is critici@@ zing the division of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , massac@@ red further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for now , special trains with refugees to Germany will not be given anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is designed to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T want to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T invested 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter remaining space in the building has already been rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
Jutta Br@@ eit really wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ habit@@ ee of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade had to push ahead with this plan : after all , she has now grown into another business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available starting at 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
for me most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women come into rap@@ ture when they look at a hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the last certainty .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is used for every outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ off .
whether it expresses xen@@ opho@@ bia , journalists scrut@@ iny or reveals gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls up the election campaign strongly .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ refresh@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village are related to him over ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their c@@ ity@@ scape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , alongside Tru@@ mp , also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also at word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in high German : the don@@ ors , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the investors .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state at which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because once he was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had explained to the start of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked to Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dis@@ soci@@ ated by the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so crum@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension @-@ owner Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts on the fact that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family paid a visit to the church organ in a visit to the church organ , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says win@@ emaker Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tru@@ mp has been interviewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , including in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the Today &apos;s Reviews .
the N@@ ine Breakfast Show was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the hosts of David Cook and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of the Executive Board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators in the five capitals , compared with today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , in recent months , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August , Today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wit@@ ty father who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour there were 7@@ 20,000 spectators .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine feel confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will surely not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you might have acci@@ dently added a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a per@@ ni@@ cious person who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten Th@@ rough on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter CAM In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team co @-@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that appears now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high refugee figures .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of F@@ W fall @-@ fall in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sunday survey of free voters will last until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the cla@@ ws , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it was during the wars in Yugoslavia during the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to deal with the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free V@@ ector . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum procedures : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bol@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need federal standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in the large @-@ scale city should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing permanent torch remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; middle level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the secondary school is three to four years .
but that &apos;s not far enough ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

the German stock market has closed off with profits following a long @-@ distance and nervous trading history .
it was only in the afternoon that a festive pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges provided a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ Da@@ x medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Bör@@ j@@ ans expect the markets to take place until after the interest decision in the US and also to the great decline in the fut@@ ures fairs on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the burdens resulting from the nuclear phase has temporarily de@@ pressed the RW@@ E &apos;s shares to a record low and also left deep traces at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered some , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors obliged to pay less attention to the German chip maker .
investment in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold more than in the same period the year ago , as the industry association AC@@ EA gave in to the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of the Daimler and BMW cars grew by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot down rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , chief district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last one in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ entr@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been ruled out for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the land at Em@@ my Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The City of Em@@ den wants to market an area of around 4,000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
the plan is to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for corresponding offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor may question , is not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no contracts have yet been concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Big Street , bought some months ago and the buildings are torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor for the first time presented publicly plans for the project .
some of the residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure facility
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , di@@ mmed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement near Em@@ den on the table lie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch left the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the ten to twelve million euros expensive project has been in discussion for months .
intense reactions among sea @-@ sea owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ pen@@ owner and member of the board in the interests of the An@@ gli@@ der , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ ter that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like some other critics , that traffic would increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come , so that that pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google starts double donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : MS@@ F without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / could be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn by the war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can help easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of O@@ bes@@ ity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ cer formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease worsen@@ ed completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes achieved completely only at one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the hom@@ ec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and se@@ eded a complete over@@ burden of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently taking into consideration in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must reflect on how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent response of the United States pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this prov@@ oked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the U.S. report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 , swal@@ lowing strongly alcoholic hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 report from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said some children deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how adolescents drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children a few spra@@ ys can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry @-@ fra@@ grant hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their space .
the police looked at the sh@@ rou@@ ded plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and inter@@ sec@@ ted disciplinary measures to the school authority .

in the accident @-@ taking vehicles involved , non @-@ damage of around 10,000 euros was incurred , the police disp@@ at@@ ched .

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no cli@@ ma@@ xes of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and not only are the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss swe@@ ars to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stands at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January @-@ transfers
despite his comments , only a few weeks ago , indicating that he split a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about signing new appro@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer season have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mik@@ u with reference ID
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stur@@ mer Mik@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires on the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the defender was removed later - the third Red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s executive board has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but it is up to the fact that the decline in the playing field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will get the guys back on tro@@ t again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Allen is happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Allen sum@@ mon@@ ed that his team of Aber@@ deen fac@@ tor@@ ily had to fight against Hamilton assets to win a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points in front of Celtic at the top of the table due to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Allen said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won it all , in poker games or le@@ agues , which games of this kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases as a whole .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statistics Bureau ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at all times .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
persu@@ aded man to hunt after damp police ch@@ ase to get out of the c@@ anning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he spoke to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he addressed a more reliable tactic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to stop racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt tu@@ pi test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had posted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com stating that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will design@@ ate - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should that lead me to the opinion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I &apos;m it .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainers &apos; fru@@ stration levels have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ et@@ rack treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse @-@ deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like that last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was the same on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy votes against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; Ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scarcely concealed remark to the Storm @-@ Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defending the fli@@ ck@@ ering lim@@ b of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; with tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team voice him confi@@ dently as they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson on ring games when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this repeat@@ ed@@ ely emerges at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look at as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos vs Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will be able to meet them in one phase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm @-@ Team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday evening in the Pre @-@ Finale in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin at the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ ans with a $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Dru@@ gs
a man who might face a life sentence due to his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ like penalty for trying to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions he gave his Australian and his Serbian passport to sign up with the police every day and stay at an exit from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab rides apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the auto@@ bahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday night .
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed .
the driver &apos;s cab torn apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when he fell asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ interrupted images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hunter .
she saw it , found the confused messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web research that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ ut@@ ary E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused wanted computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked a lot younger than him .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the restrictions on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence lawyer Gregory S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael ceased judgment by October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases pending .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ us@@ men benefited from the fear of discovery and arrest of people on smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dust @-@ guns on the German side .
there they are received from federal polic@@ emen and forwarded to the registration .
as compared to the weekly start on Wednesday , more refugees met again at Munich Central Station in comparison to the weekly start of the week .
some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who in recent days moved from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected most of all in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Lake Constance , with bows of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new premium and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel has launched a new entry below the largest rival VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16,@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with a 74 kW / 100 hp engine .
furthermore the Hessen also offer other diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the major rival VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Me@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a high@@ - sporting GT version .
at the beginning of next year , he will come to trade , and then as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the new model will be able to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .

Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger used hand in front of the front panel : the radi@@ ator grill was re @-@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated in Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court issued a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Law of Justice of Justice , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined to tight spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison complex ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his attorney , is now again on the free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his detention was failed because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin .
however , the constitutional judges took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and returned the case back again .
they see the man &apos;s dignity wounded .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ grav@@ ating the legal protection of personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they spoke only in April a det@@ ain@@ ee of damages because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ decent housing to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged for three months between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also entered the head@@ lines due to missing staff .
prisoners are therefore locked up again and again 23 hours increasing aggres@@ siveness , even in massac@@ res , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ amt , 21 points in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in light of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Transport ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing each year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
however , scientists and the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs agree that there must also be more tax benefits for residential construction investments .
the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) estimates that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , would not systematically ask the refugees in Germany after their qualification to help them get started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they will find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the esteem in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers from up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in the company - also because of the shortage of skilled staff - there has also been a majority of the points of view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of knowledge of German .
to date , there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that workplaces are most often communicated through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the Royal Road for integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ enig@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
to convince the family nonetheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example by allowing more specialized schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for classes without any knowledge of the language .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s case from the Berlin school administration .
the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Land Land forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be made easier to access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law , when they start studying .
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the benef@@ ici@@ ary persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this will be shortened to 15 months .
however , this gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state churches law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization who took care of newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights are also duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be a topic for the whole of society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , forcing the exploitation of discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender E@@ quality Act since a decade .
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U hom@@ icide series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention of Germany undertake must become reality in the next few years , if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens want to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , says the president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals after registration of health cards .
services rendered could be deduc@@ ted later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cast so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seek@@ er law prescri@@ bes .
otherwise , the doctors are doing the language barriers in particular .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in doctors &quot; sur@@ geri@@ es , translation costs would need to be taken over .
however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic look .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated obstruc@@ tions , and in the youth it is about HIV @-@ enligh@@ tenment .
but with the partially different disease pictures , German doctors from her training come to the fore , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; Paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; don@@ ka , the refugees may even have a relief in sight .
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , some refugees even were doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and possibly put out tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , an early treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , up to now only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices , mostly non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide if a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ interpretations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst interven@@ es on the traditions of circus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group into the fascination of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the family thus lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to take up the Cuban duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ve , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst looks also with finger @-@ tip @-@ feeling and joint @-@ feeling .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ people are fascinating and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t go well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the highest commandment : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so for every visitor there should be something about it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with you whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had hired him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the parliament members that immunity is ending in parliament , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later divide into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the anticipated loss of jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a statement from the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company established in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and , in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a big issue .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player attempts to return right in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of po@@ ach@@ ers since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games over the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from injury , you have a prone period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey had not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , judging by the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven away from the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 was announced as the Year of the Man with the aim of questioning the culture that men are hin@@ dering to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms established that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , viable and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which has a much deeper effect on our mental health .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to explore fully their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions among friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ festival this weekend with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning until the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria met in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here is the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ son Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their advantage when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris also takes a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not score another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which last weekend had a 2 : 2 tie in his own court against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing@@ ed door became known as the man who was taken over PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat &apos;s passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed past Johan Wil@@ and passed beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but except a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some mal@@ occ@@ lu@@ tions and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five attempts hit him alone in the first half and then abandoned after the restart of Cav@@ ani .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ hem in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored the sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thinking that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before replacing Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi one goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core g@@ athers $ 2.5 billion in share sales
mining Ri@@ ese Glen@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a share sale on Wednesday as part of its huge debt plan .
the London registered company Glen@@ core stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a disa@@ strous impact on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange at trading on Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion dollar share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices dropped by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was a few years ago , shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish Champion , three times Cup winner , four times champion League winner , twice champion champion , twice champion champion , twice champion , the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already in front of Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won it all , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was also the case of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern Bavaria .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça did contract Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds broke out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s King triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it during the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a mare that is struck by her white col@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dear White People &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opted for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on responded that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the Social Media explo@@ ded prior to dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 rescu@@ es and 4,000 lic@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement scored nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against color @-@ based content .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Albums still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in more recent times leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , if the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned the first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which just finished their seventh season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the final task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the ar@@ du@@ ous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he did the first course at all , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the final place in the American league Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American league game @-@ card room .
for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit first scored in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of any game , and therefore I want to go completely concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the sleep well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy handed over the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the two @-@ run ri@@ ot of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen put the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play .
it was the 27 time in the Major League for the 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was playing a Double Play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , the Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano on three pitches for his fifth seed .
Detroit was the pr@@ elu@@ de to the game by an even non @-@ mov@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed player , who had been painted before the game from the injury list after he had been missing for more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I was going and felt I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , they fl@@ ushed a single to second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one scored a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not beat well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw train .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the injury list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be shel@@ ved in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden cured on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an capital of Bavaria have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen , responsible for the first admission .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective punishment . &quot;
four years ago , it was very happy that the cup has passed a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern limits .
Austrian Minister for Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary , no one is now sent back .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said there had already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees in a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries in the initial admission and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who would need protection , too .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view has been dealt with strongly in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania would be sealed with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling cre@@ denti@@ als over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , as a result of e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants are on the way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
a global ocean sw@@ ells beneath the Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us ice cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the moon is easy on its path around the ring plane .
although it is small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

according to Munich lions , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to break four weeks of forced dis@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thereby support visually impaired vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it mi@@ tig@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

the company has already begun the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
above all drivers are sought .
last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries delayed the parcel service to harsh criticism .
first F@@ öh@@ n@@ sturm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday , the F@@ öhn winds blow through the F@@ öh@@ ner valleys .
at the end of the morning on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys on the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the F@@ öh@@ n@@ tal valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance into the adjoining Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even Or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dri@@ es for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture on the alpine slope starts to st@@ ow .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , a total of more than 100 litres of rainf@@ all per square meter has to be expected .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn blows the air , in which a cold front rolls with a powerful , partly whe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind picks up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place was chri@@ sten@@ ed in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place is symbol@@ ised that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a promised sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the ab@@ dic@@ ation .
hammer artist invested three years in his personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs expressed his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has taken a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subjects of the book of all books .
these are cycles dedicated to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ dding or pat@@ ernity .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his theological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into today , translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to give twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant rulers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education was already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to be able to carry on my father &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to restore art more promin@@ ence in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed world : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterized today by advertising , and it is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; let them look , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ zep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care not to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans , place , company commissioned to model earth hills for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finished .
failures in politics and administration led to dr@@ oning , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways .
so hill scre@@ ened , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be received in October , the first female Prime Minister , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck , was now informed in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still be visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the increasing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policies to help tackle the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; declares K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some Bundes@@ liga also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs take a clear sign if they will carry the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , head of the newspaper Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use our football team , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the EM @-@ qualifying game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this year and next year , the Association together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the Federal Government will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called all the sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive officer loses one eye in the event of accident
according to several reports , the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
after midnight on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US he fell on a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then out of sex onto the street - he told us this past week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League finally fell apart .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga also in the du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of its pros , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem from the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of Ma@@ zu@@ ki &apos;s novel .
&quot; he trains an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all of Europe @-@ League matches , he left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , mid @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl respects : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot au@@ tos : government wants pioneering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the Frankfurt Motor Show in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy transfer to digital radio communications .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; examine the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only provided people as drivers .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible until 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads will only be expected to reach far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D spokesman for transport , S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey conducted by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic could be at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Düsseldorf @-@ based team wants to stay in singles for the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision should be made on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship programme in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo fled , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg .

it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look frigh@@ tening thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with it he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is a good luck that the designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been in Canada &apos;s Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the almost un@@ seen work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort has been carried out : for example , a sty@@ list was used for fr@@ aming the dolls .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material were m@@ apped to Munich .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers &apos;s old ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts by the designer .
as a kid ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the designing of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze
it used to be about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large quantity for customers , which they used for example to process curtains and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a major role , then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past breast@@ plates , is an increasing order potential .
those who have no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s lace and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .

our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold through chains .
furthermore , export is weaker , current to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery industry in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; for this year we have been running a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter recre@@ ated the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine pul@@ ls small balls at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took the inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a memory .
thus I see my jewellery as a modern messenger of the P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ film but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic little girl girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already well known : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should invest in attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new spin @-@ offs and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident status system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing business environment and stream@@ lining the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fishing
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus offer consumers a considerably higher dose of the neur@@ on tox@@ in .
the Food@@ watch consumer organisation , which is present in the EU &apos;s working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mistaken industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of the still existing limit values , about 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in contrast to this e@@ asing , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
Food@@ World@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller grav@@ ey@@ ards , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of cl@@ oning is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is rich in predat@@ ory fish across the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities of particularly low @-@ bor@@ ns damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants trigger more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
