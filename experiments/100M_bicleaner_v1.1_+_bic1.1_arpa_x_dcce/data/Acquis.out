consultations on issues arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be conducted on the request of the organization , the community or a state .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
any disputes which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be resolved with the exception of any disputes which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , and which shall not be settled in the course of negotiations or by another by the organization , the community and the states , to submit to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth , who pres@@ ides .
if the Community and the States or the Organisation have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbitr@@ ator , the Community or the organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint this arbitr@@ ator .
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or nom@@ ination of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen .
a majority of members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organization , the community and the affected states .
a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and
( II ) if the association of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on the request of one of the contracting parties on a change of that convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this Agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when carrying out the provisions of Part I of the Part I .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of early detection .
for the achievement of the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , verbal integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the audit by the organisation is provided by an explanation in which the quantity of material which is not proven for a certain period of time is listed under specification of accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
in carrying out their investigations , the Organization makes full use of the community &apos;s security system after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
when applying their security measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , see how they are near@@ er to the supplementary agreements and are appropriate :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , bog@@ ged , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and stock ;
( B ) assessing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ating the uncertainty of the measured data ;
( C ) procedures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and receivers ;
( e ) Proced@@ ure to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured invent@@ ories and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory , including inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced to specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 do not exist , the Community is , however , not possible or desirable from residues or desirable , so consult the organization and the community on the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community perceive that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community the organisation liber@@ ates core material , which would otherwise be subject to the provisions of this Convention , from these security measures , provided the entire core material quantity liber@@ ated in the States is at no point in time as
a ) A total of one kilogram of special fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liber@@ ated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to or stored in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for re @-@ use of the safety measures will be taken on that material .
the Community meets with the organization supplementary agreements , which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective exhaus@@ tion of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention shall determine in detail how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing the Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements enter into force at the same time as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states are making every effort to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period needs to be taken into account between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report presented in Article 62 , the Organization shall present a summar@@ ised inventory of the core material underlying this Convention in the States , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory list based on the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
in weighing subsequent GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is imped@@ ed by general resource problems problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle binding to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table that is evident in what manner to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; special transaction account &quot; which the Member States contribute to the transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; by the organization , and only for the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the Member State , which are paid upon request in the currency of the state in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first at the rate of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entering into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or a different date agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may be able to make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportion@@ ate conc@@ essions to the cash or the school board in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the terms of the EEC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its other lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted ; and
( VII ) The extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral Plan ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and managed for the purposes of the organization financed by the Company &apos;s ordinary funds .
the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of ord@@ inal funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which have already been bound by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are generally valid for the organization granted by the organization ; thus , in ten free years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years each .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this gift box must be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
each transaction loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the source of the means is specified in particular .
the revenue from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which the administrator has determined at the time of the loan granted , may be the recipient of a transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments made by a special transaction loan are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a Member State shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until the complete awar@@ ding of all the transaction loans , the Administrator informs the E@@ WG about the plans and programs approved by the directors through the directors in preparation .
during the period of payment of the transaction loan , the administrator shall inform the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the transactions loan and the expenses for this .
as soon as possible after termination of the financial year of the organization , the administrator sends a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC shall send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are based on account recei@@ pts and recei@@ v@@ ables received from the account and deposits paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EEC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ ward until the complete issue of the means of the special transaction account , from time to time , lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may agree on , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be ob@@ sol@@ ete with immediate effect .
if the total capital amount is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from will be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications together with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally authorit@@ ative .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter to the amend@@ ment of Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issued the following statement :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; ( Bundes@@ rat ) ,
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation are transferred to a Joint Company according to Section V of the Eur@@ atom treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contractual partners of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research activities that have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement should enable any party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by combining its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the means required for mutual research work , thus achieving the common objective of this research , i.e. , by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster .
to achieve the objective of this agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , called &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss Programme will take over long @-@ term objectives and the forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or amended by the bodies mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , so that there may be new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contractual parties accept a new program , this will be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- the exchange of staff under the laboratories in the Eur@@ atom EU Member States , in Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom closed a similar agreement as the present agreement , referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program ;

with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of the human resources exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resource exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland , with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , belongs to the Joint Enterprise J@@ ET whose Articles of Association are accepted .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom also contributes to the fact that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose goal is to be concluded in the framework of this agreement , except association agreements or other similar tre@@ aties concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies involved in carrying out the Association provided in Article 2 , 1 of the present Convention are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement must , in particular , include the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the commission and the Bundes@@ rat .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ations in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used as part of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
it promotes co @-@ operation and coordination between the associated bodies and direc@@ ts its T * activity in the interests of the two contracting parties in the interest of the two contracting parties to the common goal laid down in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss agenda , and to the scientific and technological developments that are indic@@ ative in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created as part of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek it .
the advisory groups that the VG research proposals dissemin@@ ate with regard to the fact that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , this task is true with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom programme .

the coordin@@ ating committees which have adequate proposals for the best possible use of resources , staff as well as the knowledge and skills that the laboratories participating in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme are responsible for all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a member state responsible for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country .
on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F cons@@ ults the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programmes and the definition of their overall scope , co @-@ ordination and integration of national activities at Community level within the scope of the merger .
the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Director Committee , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordin@@ ating Com@@ mittees have a consult@@ ative character .
the opinion of the VG to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel replacement .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technically @-@ consult@@ ative bodies or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of this agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount that is disputed by Eur@@ atom &apos;s share of the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the Gross Dom@@ estic Product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the common enterprise as soon as it is established .
moreover , Switzerland re@@ port@@ edly transferred an amount to the Joint Venture J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the Stat@@ utes of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Company .
the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which usually serves to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year at the beginning of the year , which amount is envis@@ aged to cover the expenditure within the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned .

in order to further simplify the procedure for adapting the customs tari@@ ff desig@@ nations in the event of renewed changes to the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of any of the contractual parties in the future , it appears further in the agreement to add an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force of 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the for@@ ego@@ ing .
I honor to confirm you the entrance of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &quot; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid , within a total limit of € 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all the future member states &apos; future delivery funds .
already , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with every stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ables , but without a total of five years .
in the opening of the credits , as well as on their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws are not made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking account of the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who made the BI@@ S applied to business under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BI@@ S must obtain the necessary funds themselves on the market , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the margin increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with a period of one year by displaying to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena shall not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured double in a suitable medium by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ tre is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the highest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated exclusively of the volume of the blood @-@ body floo@@ ding in the total volume .
for Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B@@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ s observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding .
the ti@@ ter specifies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic level of ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B and Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B bul@@ ls contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens of the Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International standard ser@@ ums anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is appro@@ ve by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ous pent@@ ox@@ ides at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that a anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to lead to specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in a fluid form or after the replacement , must be transparent and must not contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored artificial , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued can be stored for a long time from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container is a black printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid necessary for the re@@ activation ,
in addition , this label or label on the cardboard box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions provided to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid necessary for the re@@ activation ,
each shipment shall be accompanied by a certificate according to article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the Annex to this Protocol .

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may change if international standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells that contain Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are determined to use object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h @-@ system .
it re@@ acts with in@@ und@@ ations of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

sera of specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the ant@@ ei@@ ous antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of group A .

anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; there is no human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is , in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding preparation , with a flus@@ hing of blood cells of group B to ti@@ tr@@ ate ( 1 ) .
if Anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing of B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary when the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity .
