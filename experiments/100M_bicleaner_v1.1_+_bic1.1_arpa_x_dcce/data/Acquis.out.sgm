<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle binding to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table that is evident in what manner to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization directs a special account under the name "special transaction account" which the Member States contribute to the transaction account in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to as "caretaker" by the organization, and only for the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the Member State, which are paid upon request in the currency of the state in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments, namely i) the first at the rate of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entering into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon time;</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may be able to make payments in advance of the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportionate concessions to the cash or the school board in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its other lending capacity to loan conditions without discounted; and</seg>
<seg id="744">(VII) The extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development program or project (including a sectoral Plan), regardless of whether it belongs to the organisation's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and managed for the purposes of the organization financed by the Company's ordinary funds.</seg>

<seg id="751">The revenue from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which the administrator has determined at the time of the loan granted, may be the recipient of a transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments made by a special transaction loan are transferred to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in the currency of a Member State shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until the complete awarding of all the transaction loans, the Administrator informs the EWG about the plans and programs approved by the directors through the directors in preparation.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the transaction loan, the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly on the development of the transactions loan and the expenses for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible after termination of the financial year of the organization, the administrator sends a detailed account of the transaction accounts with a statement of the external auditor of the organization to this account.</seg>
