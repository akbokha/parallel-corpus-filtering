it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ y thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder where the patients have alternate episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal tuning .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied or the melting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are de@@ composed just like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to communicate with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is thought to be a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ r@@ ence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , with which from Lor@@ á@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for absor@@ bing ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than patients receiving placebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies , A@@ bili@@ fy declined in four of the five short @-@ term studies more effectively in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ á@@ ep@@ am .
the most common A@@ bili@@ fy side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , ch@@ aining ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , nausea , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients receiving mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued approval for the distribution of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union to the company of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is related to psycho@@ tic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no elevated suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in cases associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to bi@@ polar di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system caution is advisable when used in combination with alcohol or other centrally potent medicines with over@@ lying side @-@ effects such as se@@ dation ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reduction should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ kum , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ aboli@@ zing .
if one considers the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reduction should be carried out .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be raised to the dose @-@ level before the adju@@ v@@ ant treatment begins .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data storage for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in the reproductive studies of the animal , this drug may not be applied during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ab@@ norm@@ alities , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their incidence reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose cases , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause of death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein retention .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is conveyed through the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
with an application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ ty .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents in both groups were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Depression Sc@@ ale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decrease in the rate of reg@@ ression estimated at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % occurred in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial of 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptoms of sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial more than 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which sometimes did not focus on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period of more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l for extensive met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a stimulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison with young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral doses of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial of 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under wra@@ ps of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations into the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .

clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to bi@@ polar di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their incidence reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose cases , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ on@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms with regard to as@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents observed a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significant reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an ob@@ long @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.@@ 6 kg assumed an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which sometimes did not focus on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared placebo with regard to prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % bigger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which cul@@ min@@ ated in 15@@ - and 5 @-@ times over the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral doses of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
if only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines and efficacy indicators like time to wor@@ sen@@ ing of disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
it may also not be applied to patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Abra@@ x@@ ane the company Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union to the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited company .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ hili@@ a &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sensory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic Grade 3 , the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached in Grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ron number has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , kar@@ mic incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea occur in patients following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ pation treatments .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm preservation , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the ability to transport and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial once every three weeks .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ ous in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burns , dry mouth , aching gum , loose stool , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ c@@ ers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary passages :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , head@@ ache , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , chest pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequently :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in context @-@ related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the co@@ ag@@ ulation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tub@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ priv@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ corneal transport is conveyed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ any receptor and due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed invol@@ un@@ tary studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used for in@@ fusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma over 30 minutes .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 than 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of the patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ised medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the owner of the Agency will provide healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials prior to market launch :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contribution . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , provided cooling boxes for transport by patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reference Rates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be taken under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the inj@@ ections may also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency or by not responding adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced into which it enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the case of an intraven@@ ous injection , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a main study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference doctor .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ et@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ at@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union pres@@ crip@@ tions it was demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which establishes ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted mediation to the company Medi@@ ce Pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the marketing authorisation of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia during chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures which require a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to adults without lack of iron in front of a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected drop in blood of 900 @-@ 1800 ml should not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients in which ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed in one patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using IV administration if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number has increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number has increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serving is required , should be given a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each with 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation system .
patients who develop under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ster@@ one ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pro@@ s , accompanying or underlying diseases , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , Al@@ umini@@ ump@@ i@@ fication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes are normal , and if no other reason of a loss of effects is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed if ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the application of epo@@ e@@ tin if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration necessary for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evi@@ d@@ ary cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients potentially trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing extensive elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the case of a cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can be an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptoms of sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 @-@ 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in @-@ vitro studies of tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in terms of hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , ane@@ ur@@ y@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ id and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients .
it was shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression of tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed a more consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls in patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies was not explained satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no grief : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ en@@ ie , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given intraven@@ ously by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age signs with inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a given value .
according to current findings , the treatment of blood poverty with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week lag between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your secre@@ tion dose to keep the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past , thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed will act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may have a negative effect on the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of the treatment .
if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / applying other medicines or used recently / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means to build the immune system , e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a given value .

Ac@@ reli@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle the bones ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a lower @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like the eye . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
to treat the disease , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved in the first study , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in more than 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies to 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that desc@@ ends bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % against the initial value .
in the study of older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those in placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredient .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reaction to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( wi@@ ther@@ ing of bone tissue ) in the jaw@@ s .
Ac@@ reli@@ a &apos;s manufacturer provides educ@@ ators who prescri@@ be Ac@@ reli@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how the medicine is applied , and similar material for patients in which the side @-@ effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease .
after treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ burdens are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy is missing .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a prior to treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia arises , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
no data is available for patients who require dental procedures , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw@@ s .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ last@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which expressed itself as decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured yearly before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the placebo group and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the placebo @-@ treated patients .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received additional sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ ot@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the tempor@@ om@@ andi@@ b@@ ular area , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area of one with Ac@@ last@@ a and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the event of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a sen@@ sed significantly over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , of the th@@ igh@@ s by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
oste@@ o@@ hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken out of the pel@@ vic area one year after the third annual dose .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CAT ) analysis showed an increase in trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone volumes and the preservation of trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone turnover markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients during the duration of the study period .
after 12 months , B@@ SAP decreased significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the treatment in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the BM@@ D in total frac@@ tures and th@@ igh@@ s at all times .
the treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D over 24 months compared to placebo for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total frac@@ tures and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % versus 8.@@ 7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( F@@ CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ reli@@ a was not subject to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.6 @-@ fold up to 3.6 times the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain control was observed in 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six month main study were included in an observ@@ ational phase .
from 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was er@@ ect at 141 of patients treated with ac@@ stress , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ e- independent .
thereafter , the plasma gas decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a lengthy final phase of elim@@ inations with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early partial phases ( α and β , with the ab@@ ov@@ ementioned t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ al concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearance of substances zed by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ us is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in rats was determined by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use of accumulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site , occurred .
the most frequent findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , one finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was defined at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum levels .
if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human drug use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
an over@@ worked R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone was reached ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) . • On request of E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is a sub @-@ substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , above all est@@ ro@@ gens , produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation , giving the bone strength again .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
if you use Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are using / applying other medicines or used or used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drinks , make sure that you take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you recently broke the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a may work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was missed , get in touch with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before termination of treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a Falls , consider stopping the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .
physical signs because of low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , chem@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are advised to carry out the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ei@@ mia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , correspon@@ dingly at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ reli@@ a .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to in@@ fusion of Ac@@ reli@@ a .

four studies were carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for the treatment of smoking .
in contrast , studies on the perception of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of compli@@ a in this field of application was difficult to assess .
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ compli@@ a that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be applied in patients who are suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts to a small minority of patients .

also in patients who - apart from obesity - do not exhibit recognizable risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur .
relatives or other nearby persons may point out that it is necessary to monitor the re@@ occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( diabetes medicine ) is not shown .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in can be applied to patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) that cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ phen@@ olic or insulin , the current dose of sulph@@ onic resin or insulin can be maintained at the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sulph@@ onic resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ ate res@@ p showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirrors - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the tak@@ eover of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are threatened by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with elevated liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased by 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one continues , should be led by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been submitted .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) appeared as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( 1 @-@ 3,@@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with insulin or as secondary combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report defects of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthal@@ m@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the frac@@ tured frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment must be completed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one about 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin @-@ related hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ us decreases , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T en@@ grav@@ ings above the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ de .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
since its market launch , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was rarely reported under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the group treated with comparative medicine .
in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not present any symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Ph@@ .@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ en@@ ci@@ dal as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to study the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin had been random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical studies over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol was observed in most clinical trials .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gi@@ lic@@ lin@@ de and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison with placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while the values of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ lu@@ ci@@ dal were observed .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level as well as the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral treatment , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness is roughly three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it was possible to demonstrate that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
following oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma exclusion period of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys differ@@ ed after repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ us and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to an increased frequency of col@@ onn@@ tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ tured frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each have been studied with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ lu@@ cide .
clinical studies over 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was unable to determine its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .

acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ cone that indicated that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the prescription label ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh@@ ed .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transportation of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day , when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose level has improved significantly by a intensified insulin therapy may change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi @-@ phase , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is required in case of change to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosing or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and ask his patients to ask for other medicines they have taken .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with un@@ controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can result in un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death .
nervous System Diseases - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood glucose control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in the blood sugar setting may however be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the corneal tissue A@@ ci@@ ally - li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection site may develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
general ail@@ ments and complaints at the location of the injection site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) .
diseases of the immune system Blessed - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic responses symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ euro@@ tic e@@ dem@@ a , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape berries , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1,0 mg ) or glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active time is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the division is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane water bottle is removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) , before it is stressed according to the user manual for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in@@ humane ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
also , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin consumed rapidly must first be absorbed , followed by the amount of insulin that lasts .
3 If a dose adjustment is required in case of change to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
5 General disorders and ail@@ ments at the location of the injection site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that a mort@@ ality induced by intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.@@ 6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : if you are inj@@ ecting too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you are more than physically demanding
always set the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Use always a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Take the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Drag the large external cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow the steps below to avoid air injection and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • Take a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will collect them up in the cartridge • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues upwards , rotate the cartridge in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues upwards , press the pus@@ h@@ button completely in ( Figure C ) • Now you have to squee@@ ze a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the closing cap on the finished pen so that digit 0 stands opposite the metering mark ( Figure D ) • Contro@@ ll@@ ers whether the pus@@ h@@ button is pressed completely .
if the pus@@ h@@ button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The scale below the pus@@ h@@ button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the pus@@ h@@ button • add the two numbers to get the prescribed dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the se@@ aler just forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you feel a resistance . then take the cap off and put it in such a way that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
make sure to press the press button during the injection , press the button after the injection , until the injection needle has been removed from the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose which is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h nodes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ anium rocks that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; it is therefore recommended that patients take other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once daily , received a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
this was the case with 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with cardiac complaints in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary acid in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also pose a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to initial deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently existing dr@@ unk@@ ers and / or oste@@ o@@ arthritis ) .
if serum har@@ n@@ age levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dosage increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients There are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ se@@ eding medicines , a acute g@@ out attack may occur during the treatment , because the reduction of serum res@@ ins initially can be used to mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ osta treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was not carried out by F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ory can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a inhibit@@ ory of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in un@@ desirable occur@@ ren@@ ces .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of DES@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed gest@@ ures do not cause unwanted side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall construction group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol Group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection could be detected with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below .
diarr@@ hea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
for long @-@ term long @-@ term endurance studies , 9@@ 06 patients had been treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 3 years , 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years .
the related events reported during the long @-@ term long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ osta treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term endurance studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the data occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :

clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three month levels of serum urine glaucoma were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ at@@ inal value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual recommended dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

reducing the serum &apos;s acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and kept permanent over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum res@@ ins in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney functions ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum res@@ ins ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum har@@ n@@ ate concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study in phase 3 gathered in two years showed that the long @-@ term reduction of serum har@@ n@@ age levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed treatment against a g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not need to treat a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the node size , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the g@@ out nodes up to 24 months in 54 % of patients .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extensions ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ately .
for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at doses of 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed that is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ X is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage decrease of serum har@@ n@@ um acid concentration were observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma red binding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 to g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g and g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with about the 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific metabolic rate and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
in high doses , which were about 4.3 times of the human@@ istic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity emerged that accompanied by lowering the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately 4,@@ 3 times and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which stem approximately 13 times of the human@@ istic exposition , did not have ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects .

21 Off@@ ene long @-@ term endurance studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients had been treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 3 years , 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three month levels of serum urine glaucoma were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data from the open extension study in phase 3 gathered in two years showed that the long @-@ term reduction of serum har@@ n@@ age levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed treatment against a g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not need to treat a g@@ out ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient should not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the Company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicates that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , ul@@ cer@@ a ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic encounter .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be used for es@@ op@@ hag@@ us disorders , in patients with hypo@@ cy@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for oral ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , be given only with special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be informed about the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ catar@@ act pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate medical advice ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to use after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , patients were rarely reported ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severely and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ ot@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapists were predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefits @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet the next morning while taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE as soon as they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but keep taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated prior to treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
for this reason , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without inter@@ acting clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ ot@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports date from cancer patients , but it was also reported in the case of oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ um took up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups of similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ es of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cy@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ stretch @-@ dro@@ be to vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of the intestinal res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum Cal@@ cium , the ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures of oste@@ opor@@ otic people .

Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s therapeutic equ@@ ation once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg a day ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a single @-@ year multi @-@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the verteb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % on fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % vs pla@@ z@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved with the share of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D &apos;s asc@@ ents of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to uph@@ old ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continues to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % vs. placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Elev@@ ated to intraven@@ ous reference dosage was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then disper@@ sed rapidly into the bone or eliminated with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively lab@@ elled substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .

characteristics in patients Pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the share of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , an increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , for a period of time , more than 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t have been carried out and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f as the Ad@@ vaginal dosage or the dose of the medication taken simultaneously must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood spi@@ egel@@ cies ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post transplantation phase .
because tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ances , adjustment of the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schema can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral treatment of drugs in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion fluid ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - ren@@ al transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adju@@ v@@ ant therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adju@@ v@@ ant therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , must be carried out .
kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral starting dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin daily with the recommended oral starting dose .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients , which are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily .
in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and intestinal transplan@@ t recipients were used in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with impaired liver function in order to maintain blood c@@ ages in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ar checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the blood concentration of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood in the first period of liver transplantation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the induced form@@ ulations of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f are still available .
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided , or other remedies during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases Pro@@ gra@@ f was seen as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy which can be seen as anterior or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption are special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us blood levels with the simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
because tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase the level of hormone exposure , it is especially cau@@ tious when taking decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us could potentially l@@ essen the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular regarding its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not determined exactly because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it is possible to assume that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are likely to be conveyed by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ depend@@ ant in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B @-@ cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .
12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % within the first 24 weeks of the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported more than 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
also a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was observed in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us and 83 % of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was observed in 21.@@ 7 % compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) as the number of patients killed by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patient @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
a multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tations that received a random@@ ized tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
col@@ on transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism brought about by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f .

advances are used for the treatment and prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder due to the lack of Factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ant@@ ages are used for the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A patients suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced which enables it to form the human scent factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the drug application was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new bleeding episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ances ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ant@@ ages may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human scent factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for transferring Adv@@ ances across the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma gas ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , adequate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma gas is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. should be given by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II treatment is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should be directed to the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ spi@@ eg@@ els occurred in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate once again showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE of 145 children and adults 2 with severe severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and severe severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed after prior exposure to Factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) of a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE were treated with inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported to report on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 How with other intraven@@ ous products was reported to A@@ DV@@ ATE about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still evaluated the benefits risk balancing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , so that the authorisation holder is to apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially distributed the CH@@ MP Committee to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company accepts its application for approval for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
it is a kind of virus that has genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene is normally used to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ growth , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been sufficiently demonstrated to bring Adv@@ ex@@ in inj@@ ections in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours benefits for patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notify the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified active ingredients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages , caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be completely taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients under aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ical hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disturbances and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ o@@ ia ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have a cereb@@ ral isch@@ emia ( stroke ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transportation of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking it or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the absence of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine contains , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after such treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be applied per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ ally as ab@@ u@@ sive r@@ hin@@ ologic ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ kin olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment with hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or strengthening of head@@ ache ) must be stopped .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ d@@ ati@@ cal ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the mat@@ ological tests are carried out , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hibit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a light @-@ he@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als .
head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , t@@ innitus , tax@@ onom@@ y , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ al cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ or@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the overall score for the symptoms ( except the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
within a single dose @-@ study of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
following the disper@@ sive application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly ex@@ changeable .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) from P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination did not have greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ity studies the combination of lau@@ rel / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to develop its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and t@@ ear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

inform your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosed with the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • Heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ ache , or strengthening existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for use in recommended dosage , it is not expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to light @-@ he@@ ade@@ dness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should check immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the dose as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whist@@ ling breath , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes were reported .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach problems , diarr@@ hea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , conv@@ ul@@ sions , liver inflammation and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values have also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a for insertion ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by identifying changes in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , disability of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( number of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies at ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any other ingredient .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( on@@ set of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been terminated and res@@ um@@ ed when re@@ appearing .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not identified as part of clinical trials with de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to light @-@ he@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth drying ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose @-@ study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ or@@ oz@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses , administered over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear duc@@ ts and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria it will also lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the itch of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with placebo in comparison to 19 % of the treated treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wa@@ xes , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , where the patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with lau@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have reduced their metabolic rate and experience a higher level of substance ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is yet metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose @-@ study in adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
for an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ omot@@ or activity .
clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults resulted in the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to increase alcohol @-@ induced power har@@ dening nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children aged between 2 and 11 with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted to metabolic disorders .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x @-@ values of des@@ lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n were compared with pedi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III bra@@ ided bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling from 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate must be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose @-@ study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose stud@@ y@@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measured values of flight performance including strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear duc@@ ts and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the processed tablet can be removed without damaging it .
efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets for the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the lau@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ ren and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a to be taken into account .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard parameters of flight performance including strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was however not different from that of the general population .
in single dose @-@ crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ treatment studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets increase the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 .

the safety of de@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is yet metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that metaboli@@ se normal .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ ol@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of side effects in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the placebo group in the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 years .
the recommended doses were similar to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms and
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially notified to the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its request for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quickly in a contact with a flu virus .
afterwards , the membrane covering of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) was puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you would like to participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
as@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV amount in the blood when taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
aids not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug used with low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who previously had prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the change in virus load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , as@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after four weeks compared to those who received their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded in the same way as as@@ gener@@ ase and are detri@@ mental to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ eri@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( the death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children were out@@ weigh@@ ed over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transportation of as@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ ar should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for insertion are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dosage for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the suppl@@ anting addition of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time using medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also present substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ ar during the intake of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure in the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with previously impaired liver function , including chronic hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids and supp@@ res@@ sions of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
for patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma gas of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ ar ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for pick @-@ up symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ age of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have reported an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , which leads to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ect@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also present substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in trying to balance the degra@@ ded plasma seal through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already receiving St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ ade mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
in contrast , 5@@ 08 % increases , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme .
52 % decreases if pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed to use as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but it is recommended that Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase income diver@@ ge at least one hour ( see below ) .
for this reason , in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce serum concentrations of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma gas .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out , as an accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with as@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions , associated with these medicines , when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it may cause res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r may result in a degradation of the plasma gas of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine .
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual impair@@ ment and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r received 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , fluor@@ esc@@ onal pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of as@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ tical cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism varies greatly from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced enh@@ ancements of the plasma gas are expected at simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zing the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with the or@@ ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see paragraph 4.3 ) , while con@@ serving with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am at the same time .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for pick @-@ up symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the reduced reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust how the amp@@ avi@@ r@@ - dosage is to be adjusted if am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the event of simultaneous adoption of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore , alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ling in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of the offspring , including fertility and reproductive ability , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most adverse events associated with as@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely used for treatment .
in many of these events it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or if they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) performed by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of common laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ c fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s , in 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and stepped up spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ect@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were similar to the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ ran@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial represented a four @-@ logical failure by week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients en@@ rolled with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure more than 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / S / T / M / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance testing .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that disp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ en@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ta@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , appear to call forth ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early failure of a failing treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly baked with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non@@ slip threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of non @-@ oo@@ ster A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients receiving PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ baked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
by contrast , 5@@ 08 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ dynam@@ o@@ ar ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was therefore unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound dynam@@ o representing the active portion is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a medium of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily routine of amp@@ avi@@ r as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and e@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ ar and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous dosing of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , there is little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and In @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse M@@ utation Test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , M@@ ouse &apos;s lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical trials no significant liver toxic@@ ity has yet been observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to a therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the suppl@@ anting addition of p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the con@@ current application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction ; it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in contrast , 5@@ 08 % increases , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ dynam@@ o@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be carried out , as an accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although there are no clinical data available .

in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r received 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , fluor@@ esc@@ onal pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
in the event of simultaneous adoption of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % resp@@ . respectively .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ling in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ baked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for insertion are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to inhal@@ e ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dosage for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dose adjustment for am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ age , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure in the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and result in P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual impair@@ ment and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
on the basis of the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as@@ gener@@ ase solution to the intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ling in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or if they are a result of the underlying disease .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is administered three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
the cream is th@@ inn@@ y to apply to the affected skin surfaces before bed@@ time , so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo followed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the full recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with placebo in comparison to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) take place before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is to continue until all visible fa@@ war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intense local inflamm@@ ations occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examinations 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area to apply until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily famili@@ arity was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a circumc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision were observed .
for an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème in higher doses than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which made treatment necessary and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency treatment and treatment of the affected area .
prior to treatment with other cut@@ aneous war@@ ts for the treatment of external war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al region , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has no clinical experience .
although limited data points to an increased rate of war@@ ping deduc@@ tions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown less efficacy in this patient group with regard to the removal of cow@@ ards .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or reactions are returned after treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not present clinical experience , the application for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
very limited data is available on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arm and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 patients showed a less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory characteristics , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) were obtained neither after one @-@ time nor after repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding period .
the most frequently communicated and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side @-@ effects .
in these studies , the most frequent , prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , was a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ tion / fl@@ aps / fl@@ aps ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ formation and en@@ caps@@ ulation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies examining the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the most serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to show that the efficacy with regard to complete healing of the cow@@ ards was clearly superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of the 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine the pre@@ tz@@ els were completely cured ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data available from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at three weeks of application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 of treatment area on the scal@@ p or face .
the first @-@ year results from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications are external past@@ erns , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma typically do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the half @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours on the site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for man due to systemic exposure is regarded as very low .
tum@@ ours performed in the group of mice that were treated with the active @-@ free cream , formerly and in greater numbers than in the control group with inferior U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ en@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient performs this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 I / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule is recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule is recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only occur in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ re@@ ation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against larv@@ ae , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related response must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment has to be handled with caution .
60 minutes before starting in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rates to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk over breast milk , it is recommended to not qu@@ en@@ ch during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly defined as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory stagn@@ ation and visual e@@ dem@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children &apos;s un@@ desirable drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ iry form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version was performed within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . in patients under 5 years of age , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version usually occurred within a month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to early retirement from the study ) 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies that were det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ eci@@ al ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients who had never come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ di@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ or effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of the enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and is absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study investigating the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the anticipated value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute foot@@ path in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk which is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ AG mirrors was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease incidence between the patients , which was taken into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with the severe form of follow @-@ up and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of follow @-@ up ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the average follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not cause any particular risks to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
5 ml concentrate for the production of a solution in bottle ( type I @-@ glass ) with stop@@ per ( silicone @-@ chlor@@ ob@@ but@@ yl rubber ) and sealing ( aluminium ) with tear @-@ off cap ( polypropylene ) .
10 Pre@@ par@@ ation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient first the number of hat@@ ching cylinders to be dil@@ uted .
within the given time , the holder of the authorization for placing on the market must complete the following study program , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register receives long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for IV application ( see information for physicians and medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 I / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions emerged , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence at more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • Joint Diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • elevated heart • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion point
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the packaging contribution will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e according to the body weight of the individual patient first determine the number of hat@@ ching cylinders to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , &quot; which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients previously untreated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( one vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) .
in patients whose blood pattern changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , lowered or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spl@@ itting .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural pel@@ ic@@ om , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el compared to 7.@@ 9 months .
in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , had longer survival compared to the comparable medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the publishing market of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. .
each bottle must be dissolved with a ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the necessary volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow cylinder and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except in over@@ weight plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except in over@@ weight plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours , approximately 30 minutes after completion of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as IV in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the incidence and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake should be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also have to receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood pattern should be created prior to each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
a dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r &apos;s N@@ adi@@ rs or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be further treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( with the exception of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be abor@@ ted if a ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so on in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies do not show that patients aged 65 years or over 65 years of age have an increased side effects risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dose @-@ adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose @-@ adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in case of metast@@ ases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone @-@ key immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ron count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees of 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was considered when a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the toxic@@ ity of treated toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom a therapy with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is provided must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ term for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant liquid buil@@ du@@ p in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 main cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated lifel@@ ine vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be referred to in front of the treatment order to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced prolonged occurrence of side effects .
caution is therefore advisable if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data concerning the interaction potential of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the con@@ current application with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - res an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in the case of an application during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be applied during pregnancy unless necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is caused by emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be informed before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of sperm .
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed transfers into breast milk and un@@ desirable effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects Frequ@@ ency indication : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) and not known ( based on the available data from spontaneous reports ) .
* Cover to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC version 2 for each toxic@@ ity level excluded the event &quot; Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &quot; * * which was derived from the term &quot; kidney / genital tract others . &quot; * * * Be@@ aked at National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should be reported to taste disorder and hair loss only as degrees 1 or 2 .
for this table a threshold of 5 % was determined in relation to the recording of all events in which the re@@ portable doctor held a connection with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed random@@ ized ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 26@@ 5 patients who were random@@ ized to receive treatment of foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as well as 27@@ 6 patients who were random@@ ized to receive doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el as mon@@ otherapy .
* Reg@@ arding National Cancer Institute C@@ TC version 2 for each toxic@@ ity level . * * Based on National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) hair loss should only be reported as degrees 1 or 2 .
for this table a threshold of 5 % was determined in relation to the recording of all events in which the re@@ portable doctor gave a connection to tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed for possible .

clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Level 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 2 composition of three single P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed Mon@@ o@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.@@ 3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are probably due to differences in patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported to &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC , which were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

E@@ MP@@ ER@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind Phase 3 study from A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural ple@@ ura showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage over patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin alone .
the primary analysis of this study was undertaken in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural pel@@ ic@@ om was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in comparison to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a delay of the lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on the overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 61 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

analysis of influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the overall population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients required the addition of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed as a mono@@ therapeutic agent were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - zones over a period of 10 minutes .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly left in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in urine within 24 hours of application .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the production of an in@@ fusion elimination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of a concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion release
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who received no prior chemotherapy to treat the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural pel@@ vic ( malign@@ ant disease of the ri@@ b coat ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer .
if you have kidney disease or had one earlier , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmac@@ ist , as you may not be allowed to obtain A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
you will be carried out before any in@@ fusion blood tests ; it checks whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and if you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or stop the treatment if it is your general condition and if your blood values are too low .
if you also get c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after the C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin application .
if there is a fluid accumulation around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you are looking for a baby during the treatment or during the first 6 months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
drug interactions . please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) , such as such medicines called &quot; non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including medicines that are not subject to prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned da@@ - tum of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take , and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medication .
a hospital pharmac@@ ist , nursing staff or a doctor will mix A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be you cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( 4 mg dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ son twice daily ) , which you must take on the day before , during and during the day following the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) for inhal@@ ation or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain foli@@ c acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take a daily while using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in the week before the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and about every 9 weeks ( after 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this use information , a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it was reported by at least 1 out of 100 patients but less than 1 of 10 patients were reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fatty diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , thereby preventing a quarter of the fats led with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed into the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who received All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight could be observed for patients .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ c@@ comb , bow@@ string , fatty / o@@ ily chair , drop down secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or in breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , gre@@ asy diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , in elderly patients and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine ( see Section 4.5 ) • Response time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic check , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma seal was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ enes in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional vitamin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side @-@ effects observed after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered three times a day in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dosage of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects resulting from the loc@@ ating properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is used in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine due to co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ b @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic passages .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat@@ ted diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest loss of weight occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin che@@ ated with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of LD@@ L cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 . in general , non @-@ metabolic or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be demonstrated spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bid dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ t@@ ine ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ shaped leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified which represented nearly 42 % of total plasma concentration .

if you miss a meal or a meal does not contain fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see paragraph 4 ) .
to famili@@ ari@@ ze your body with the new eating habits , start before the first capsule take @-@ in with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ du@@ et diet .
food di@@ aries are effective as you can keep track of what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
to achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Nutri@@ ent st@@ ole fat to reduce the likel@@ ihood of dietary supplements ( see paragraph 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • St@@ ay physically active while taking and after taking all@@ i .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment , as you may not have reduced the amount of fat in the diet at this time .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional supplements : • Start a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ du@@ ed diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you from losing your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take for each meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Do not store drugs accessible to children . • Do not use more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at a maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
what amount is appropriate for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can not process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of dietary supplements . • You should try to increase gradually and steadily .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended intake of calories . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you do not go on stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities daily . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies which are the medi@@ oc@@ ative triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient contributes to the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ is studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the 24 hours following chemotherapy , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not able to vom@@ it ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the 24 hours following chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not able to vom@@ it ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission approved Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ is is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required at the same time offering Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with the Q@@ t interval extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hi@@ bits the activity of the five studied chemotherapy agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical trial showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population analysis , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) have no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) were observed at a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who were at least possibly related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 25@@ mg / m2 of d@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were compared to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron receiving intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of trials with chemotherapy @-@ related chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of preliminary clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ o @-@ isation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. arranged Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
after IV administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ological half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ related in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ y / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous injection of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients ( ± SD ) increased in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time use of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on met@@ aboli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron metabolism .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although the terminal elimination period and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased in patients with severe liver dysfunction , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure , which are considered adequate over the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies , there is evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of the action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) that were given daily over two years led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time use in humans , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the announcement of approval for the placing of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reference Rates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon is intended to be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , liver tissue damages damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon using Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor .
the study was measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
furthermore , concerns were expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed may not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was again fl@@ amed in more patients than in the reference doctor &apos;s drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test conducted in the study investigating the question of the extent to which the medicine receives an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection that is accompanied by cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ thes ( cracks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections proven or believed to be caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the surface to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ angen , about 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ter@@ med cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go bil@@ led during short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation due to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine , treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies of secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ il@@ ful skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean retin@@ ulin ( AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased after topical application of 1 % retin@@ aph@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retin@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity according to oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the effects on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / stop , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy should be weigh@@ ed for .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have been used by Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation was at the location , which concerned approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) by fermentation .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding point of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data points out that the binding point is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding area and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hibit the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection appears question@@ able due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , consultation by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ opathy against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % retin@@ aph@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and but@@ ton@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % retin@@ opathy of o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of pe@@ eled skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , carried out over 14 days there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro @-@ examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rat @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of pe@@ eled skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were found in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
this is why Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the existing vacc@@ ination plan can be terminated in two doses .
if a refreshing dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines contribute to &quot; teach &quot; the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the V@@ acc@@ ine Ad@@ ded V@@ acc@@ ine , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 by Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
since the rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical contents , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ et Ad@@ ults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix in a six and 12 month interval between inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als .
the standardization plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is requested for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even when antibodies are no longer det@@ ectable .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic response after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units of in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in patients with hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the basic di@@ mm@@ ation , so that there may be additional doses of other vacc@@ ines in these cases .
as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding .
if ambition in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ure@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be deemed to have no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the previous thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness on a basis basis per acc@@ ine dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix were reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ edness was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vaccine ) with 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % among the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was small and similar to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
the percentage of vacc@@ inations reported via severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine combination with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of in@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ inations between 1 and 15 years old , the Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 according to the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine compared to Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with an ambi@@ an or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination regi@@ men .
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination regi@@ men .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the refres@@ her chim@@ era of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for previous formulation for the current formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ di@@ ation to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as through bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete line of vacc@@ ines has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both doses , ( though you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has already an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
in case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with an ambi@@ an .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective constitu@@ ents per acc@@ ine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a de@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes an ambience of people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened by a disease or a treatment in your body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo / undergo a h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without sp@@ elling ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated or have received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / has or has planned this in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with ambience , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast @-@ feeding women , unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dis@@ connected cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort to the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 de@@ bil@@ led dos@@ ages ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 displaced doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or extended ras@@ hes , which can be it@@ ching or blowing , swelling of the eye area and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness .

23 Get your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects causes you / your child to be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been known since obtaining the initial approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposition .
am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ary is - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a gastro@@ intestinal tube ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) resp@@ . a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( i.e. without drug ) .
am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps may also lead to loss of appetite , an abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impotence , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste speech , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allowed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fests form ( complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use when there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking account of protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ a bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disturbances as there is a risk of the origin of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dosage .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a formation .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is performed over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of the patients had at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate deposit , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at intraven@@ ous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , which is secre@@ ted by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % , but even in those patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with late @-@ mani@@ fests form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ go@@ tic form of the or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ sti@@ al disorders ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma gas were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
secre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no adverse effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ intestinal tube or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept inside the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ a bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4@@ m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dosage .
if rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ aboli@@ t of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before birth , l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ am@@ idal cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate deposit , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it may be assumed that for each gram , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
during the dur@@ ations of durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring sco@@ op of 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or if you have recently taken other medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste disturbances , hin@@ dran@@ ces of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory defic@@ its and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , fatigue , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ iry date on the box and the container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Use up to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exp@@ iry date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or if you have recently taken other medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS spread out on equal single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ bri@@ a ( tube , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ ap@@ ed measuring spoon Gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the tank .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stopping &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medication for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) using the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another antibody ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , other har@@ p@@ ines or any other ingredient .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the market launch of An@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ range inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed once again for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a pressure of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a common bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI en@@ cro@@ achment is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt must be of 0.3 mg / kg / weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed before use and the body dose should be administered quickly intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is properly administered .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al dysfunction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , it is necessary to admini@@ ster a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and to re@@ consider the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dosage .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after receiving the IV administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding caused by a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another antibody ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial spots occur in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can undergo bleeding during treatment .
in patients taking War@@ far@@ in and being treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine reaches the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
the combination of bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants regul@@ ates the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters regularly .
animal studies are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ bonding , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ ques@@ tioning He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ valent group and in comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently came to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the point area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , Re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ zations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the bi@@ valent group and in comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently came to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ@@ ics in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ant inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on bin@@ der region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
moreover , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din had no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is supported by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din was given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , an un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ range inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1 @-@ year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for the patients receiving A@@ spir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ qu@@ etry according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the division of the AR@@ G@@ 3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
elimination is performed in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a temporal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals in repeated or continuous exposition ( 1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10 @-@ fold of the clinical Ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was restricted to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects following long @-@ term physiological stress in response to non @-@ hom@@ est@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short exposure to those in clinical use , even at very much higher dosage .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter time of activity than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type 2 diabetes , where the body does not affect insulin effectively , was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ poly@@ sis .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transportation of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneously by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose level and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of activity , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ ar@@ ded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosing or abor@@ tion , especially in patients with insulin @-@ requiring diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ yr@@ amid , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of aff@@ inity such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ vation .
animal studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between in@@ tra @-@ ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ pin enters human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral use .
following are listed in clinical trials known un@@ desirable drug cur@@ es , grouped according to system organ@@ ics and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .

pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy will be fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , as a result a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous doses of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially due to skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ cer@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the active @-@ time shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin lu@@ gli@@ s@@ ine demonstrated a glucose @-@ lowering effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and a dispro@@ portion@@ ate rise in the glucose @-@ giving effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that a similar post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ cer@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ cer@@ sin was in@@ gest@@ ed 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin lu@@ c@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ gli@@ s@@ ine at a dose of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal begins compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 Min . ) before the meal begins ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ te in a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ onic , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal begins ( figure 1@@ C ) .
