<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry thought and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder where the patients have alternate episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied or the melting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are decomposed just like Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that allow neurotransmitters to communicate with each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is thought to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness, with which from Loráepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in the patient's symptoms was examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for absorbing (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies, Abilify declined in four of the five short-term studies more effectively in the treatment of bipolar disorder than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Loráepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common Abilify side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrollable), chaining (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), nausea, nausea, dyspepsia (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as in preventing a new manic episode in patients receiving mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in quick control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued approval for the distribution of Abilify in the entire European Union to the company of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicidal behavior is related to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that there was no elevated suicide risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose to hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring with Aripiprazole were observed.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia appear in patients treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in cases associated with Alzheimer's disease patients treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazl treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to bipolar dities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system caution is advisable when used in combination with alcohol or other centrally potent medicines with overlying side-effects such as sedation (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reduction should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') Metabolikum, the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizing.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reduction should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, Abilify dosage should be raised to the dose-level before the adjuvant treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data storage for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in the reproductive studies of the animal, this drug may not be applied during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, abnormalities, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy and their incidence reported in treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose cases, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or intentional acute overdose with Aripiprazole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of hemostalysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose since Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein retention.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is conveyed through the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With an application of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and at the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents in both groups were similar (Aripiprazol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial of over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher decrease in the rate of regression estimated at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% occurred in significantly fewer patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, in week 12 Aripiprazol showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptoms of symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial more than 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which sometimes did not focus on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period of more than 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazol compared placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A stimulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazol and dehydro-aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison with young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects have only been observed in dosages or exposures which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">Effects included a dose-dependent non-adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin Pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State Exposition (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- metabolites from Aripiprazol in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral doses of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole were not more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after doses that led to expositions of the 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used for rapid control of tightness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazol injection solution and started with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimize the variability, an injection is recommended in the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle under wraps of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acutely therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations into the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose to hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring with Aripiprazole were observed.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a mns are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to bipolar dities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allotted dosage of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used as non-recurrent intramuscularly and which at the same time received Loráepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= poor ') Metabolizing Metabolism, the common application with high-acting inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reduction should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, Abilify dosage should be raised to the dose-level before the adjuvant treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were received intramuscularly, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allotted dosage of Aripiprazole.</seg>

<seg id="164">107 subsequent adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy and their incidence reported in treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose cases, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of detachment / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detontibility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms with regard to astibility and behavioural disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Loracepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from baseline value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents observed a response to study medication in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">A placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significant reduction in the rate of relapse at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an oblong-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg assumed an increase of at least 5.6 kg (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which sometimes did not focus on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study expansion in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazol compared placebo with regard to prevention of bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC is 90% bigger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the average time was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated dose in systemic exposure (AUC), which culminated in 15- and 5-times over the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects have only been observed in dosages or exposures which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">Effects included a dose-dependent non-adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin Pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times of middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- metabolites from Aripiprazol in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral doses of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times of middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was examined in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane patients responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines and efficacy indicators like time to worsening of disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be applied to patients who have low neutrophils in their blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted Abraxane the company Abraxane in the whole of the European Union to the Abraxis BioScience Limited company.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing treatment (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophhilia &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>

<seg id="285">While a clearly marked with Abraxane in connection with cardiotoxicity, karmic incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients following the application of Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, these can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constipation treatments.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, which do not have effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm preservation, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects like fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the ability to transport and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial once every three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, elevated blood sugar, increased phosphorous in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burns, dry mouth, aching gum, loose stool, esophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary passages:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, headache, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, chest pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in context-related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules substance that promotes the coagulation of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and within the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendocorneal transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Albany receptor and due to the albuminous protein acidic rich in cysteine) Paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-armed involuntary studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used for infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 than 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of the patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay on baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Drug exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urine secretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years, because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with abseamed must be taken under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donors, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injections may also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietinsufficiency or by not responding adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is introduced into which it enables the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the case of an intravenous injection, Abseamed was compared to a main study involving 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, compared to the reference doctor.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected to a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to amed or still received Eprex / erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streetamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, hemoglobin values were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continue to receive Eprex / erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abatamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union prescriptions it was demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which establishes abseamed, will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia during chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger surgical procedures which require a large blood flow rate (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied to adults without lack of iron in front of a major elective orthopaedic procedure in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected drop in blood of 900-1800 ml should not be applied to an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l) except for pediatric patients in which haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the physician's individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed in one patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose, which is required for controlling anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using IV administration if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the physician's individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose, which is required for controlling anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number has increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number has increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number by &lt; 0,62 cells / µl opposite the initial value, an application to the epoetin-alfa therapy is improbable and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood conserving is required, should be given a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the amed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each with 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of the dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula needle followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation system.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who develop under the treatment with any erythroposterone (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any abseamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastenie).</seg>

<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a greater elective orthopaedic procedure and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pros, accompanying or underlying diseases, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastenie (PRCA) Very rare has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, Aluminiumpification, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is low (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocytes and leukocytes are normal, and if no other reason of a loss of effects is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed if erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the application of epoetin if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration necessary for the control of the anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should not exceed 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical evidary coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to current findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa drugs and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients potentially transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim to keep the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to epoetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing extensive elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the case of a cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that treatment with epoetin alfa can be an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptoms of symptomatic anaemia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5-8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be checked and the Ciclosporin dosage should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies of tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in terms of hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, aneurythrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoietin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically-derived epoetin alfa is glycoid and is identical to the amino acids and the carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoietin, isolated from the urine of anaesthetic patients.</seg>

<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of recombinant human erythropoietin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa drugs after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than serum levels obtained after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no grief: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that descends bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% against the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study of older women, the risk of vertebrate fractures in patients under Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis treatment) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days of infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronylic acid or other bisphosphonate or any other ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reaction to infusion and osteonecrosis (withering of bone tissue) in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="583">Acrelia's manufacturer provides educators who prescribe Acrelia for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications of how the medicine is applied, and similar material for patients in which the side-effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages: • The packaging contribution • Concontraindication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with an increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with the Morbus Paget twice daily, for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Acburdens are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data on harmlessness and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with Aclasta prior to treatment with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledronylic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia arises, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with the Morbus Paget twice daily, for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to an application of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who require dental procedures, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The frequency of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 from 3.862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with renal dysfunctions, which expressed itself as decrease of the kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the creatinin-Clearance (measured yearly before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the placebo group and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l), were in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus-Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received additional sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures following a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of Zoledronylic acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to infusion, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteotecroses in the temporomandibular area, especially in cancer patients, about osteonekroses (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronylic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients performed osteonecrosis in the jaw area of one with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7.736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta sensed significantly over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 years and over had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, of the thighs by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Osteohistology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken out of the pelvic area one year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCAT) analysis showed an increase in trabeculary bone volumes and the preservation of trabeculary bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups from 517 to 1,246 patients during the duration of the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, BSAP decreased significantly by 30% compared to baseline value and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not measured routinely, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients).</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the treatment in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the BMD in total fractures and thighs at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The treatment led to an increase in BMD over 24 months compared to placebo for an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total fractures and 4.3% on the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% versus 8.7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (FCZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Acrelia was not subject to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6-fold up to 3.6 times the age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronylic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain control was observed in 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six month main study were included in an observational phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was erect at 141 of patients treated with acstress, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronat in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose- independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Thereafter, the plasma gas decreased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours, followed by a lengthy final phase of eliminations with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early partial phases (α and β, with the abovementioned t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledronutrial concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of substances zed by Cytochrom-P450-Enzymus is unlikely because Zoledronylic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction up to a creatinin-Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (Creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC, 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use, the renal tolerability of Zoledronylic acid in rats was determined by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dosage that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use of accumulated expositions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as the intravenous injection site, occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, one finding which reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was defined at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronylic acid is a sub-substance called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the thrombosis of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, above all estrogens, produced from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass, which is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone reconstruction, ensuring normal bone formation, giving the bone strength again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are using / applying other medicines or used or used recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drinks, make sure that you take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Aclasta according to your doctor's instructions.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta works for a long time, you may need another dose only after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget Aclasta may work for more than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta was missed, get in touch with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before termination of treatment with Aclasta Falls, consider stopping the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion often occur (with more than 30% of patients), but less frequent after subsequent infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="694">Please inform your doctor, chemist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects may be significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information.</seg>
<seg id="695">If the drug is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="696">Patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture are advised to carry out the infusion of Aclasta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after the administration of Aclasta patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid; this is particularly important in patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledronylic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypokaleimia can develop, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">The present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (diabetes medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin can be applied to patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyphenolic or insulin, the current dose of sulphonic resin or insulin can be maintained at the start of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulphonic resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered when using doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonate resp showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had reduced HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disorders, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirrors - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the takeover of Actos in the entire European Union to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited company.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are threatened by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in cardiac insufficiency, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased by 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone continues, should be led by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) appeared as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-2%) and haematocrits (1-3,2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who use pioglitazone as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with insulin or as secondary combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with Thiazoldindia, including pioglitazone, was reported about a occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema if patients report defects of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The fractured fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years for women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment must be completed (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from pioglitazone about 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in AUC from pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin-related hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uterus decreases, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT engravings above the triples of the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyharnde.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, cardiac insufficiency was rarely reported under pioglitazone, but more often if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the group treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the group treated with comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not present any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears to have an activation of specific core receptors (Ph.isome Proliferation) activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Glicencidal as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to study the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin had been randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients receiving only insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical studies over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18 week study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol was observed in most clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced the total plasma-glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or giliclinde and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison with placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed in pioglitazone, while the values of metformin and Gliclucidal were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced the triglyceride level as well as the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral treatment, pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness is roughly three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it was possible to demonstrate that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma exclusion period of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearances of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys differed after repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anemia and reversibly eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uterus and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other Thiazoldindia led to an increased frequency of colonntumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The fractured fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years for women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each have been studied with pioglitazone or Gliclucide.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical studies over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was unable to determine its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularisation and reascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape berries, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1,0 mg) or glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active time is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the division is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with cardiac complaints in prehistory, there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the urinary acid in the blood than Allopurinol, but could also pose a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to initial deposits (including one from the medical history known or currently existing drunkers and / or osteoarthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If serum harnage levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dosage increase can be considered on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">Efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function restriction (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents, since there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients There are no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated cardiac insufficiency, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnseeding medicines, a acute gout attack may occur during the treatment, because the reduction of serum resins initially can be used to mobilise uric acid deposits in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. with malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch-Nyhan-syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During Phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the Febuxosta treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline was not carried out by Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibitory can lead to an increase in theophylline level (a inhibitory of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Febuxostatexposition (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in undesirable occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin, without a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient required.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily had an average 22% increase in the AUC of DESipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid, containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in the CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed gestures do not cause unwanted side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall construction group compared to the Allopurinol Group in the pivotal study phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection could be detected with Febuxostat.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were atherosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated cardiac insufficiency in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and which were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">For long-term long-term endurance studies, 906 patients had been treated with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 3 years, 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The related events reported during the long-term long-term studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxosta treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term endurance studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patients years), according to the data occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hyper esthesia, eye-catching ECG, coughing, shortness, skin discoloration, skin lesions, erectile dysfunction, increase in the level of potassium in the blood, decrease of the lymphocyte number, decrease of the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The active mechanism of uric acid is the final product of the purine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction chain hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-purine-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for in vitro-inhibiting that lies below the nanomolar area.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical trial results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three month levels of serum urine glaucoma were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum creatinal value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual recommended dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum creatine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were combined for the analyses. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Reducing the serum's acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and kept permanent over the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum creatine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction (i.e. h).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC the primary efficacy endpoint was reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum resins in subjects, despite their renal function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney functions).</seg>
<seg id="1221">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resins ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of the patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum harnate concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study in phase 3 gathered in two years showed that the long-term reduction of serum harnage levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of the patients needed treatment against a gout in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients did not need to treat a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the node size, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the gout nodes up to 24 months in 54% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extensions (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportionately.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For Febuxostat doses of 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AUC is observed that is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAX is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant changes in the percentage decrease of serum harnum acid concentration were observed, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma red binding of Febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primary bond to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly caused by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, about 49% of the dose was found in the urine as immutable Febuxostat (3%), Acylglukuronid of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as unmodified Febuxostat (12%), Acylglukuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 to g / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g and g / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh-classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh-classification B) liver function restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">No significant changes were observed with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumors (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, with about the 11-fold exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific metabolic rate and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses, which were about 4.3 times of the humanistic exposure, maternal toxicity emerged that accompanied by lowering the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs that are approved in the European Union, the Company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who took Alendronate alone (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that indicates that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), ulceration (ulcera), oesophagus, ulcera (bloated abdomen) and acidic encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity to Alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients ADROVANCE may not be applied.</seg>

<seg id="1289">• The patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk for oral ulcera. • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty, be given only with special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosion, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partly these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be informed about the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrocataract pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine and recuperate medical advice (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to use after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, patients were rarely reported (after market launch) stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severely and with complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteotecrosis of the jaw, commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapists were predominantly intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicate whether the removal of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoporosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefits-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the tablet the next morning while taking a dose of ADROVANCE as soon as they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but keep taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated prior to treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of Alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">For this reason, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without interacting clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, whereby the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, for a period of time, more than 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant have been carried out and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood spiegelcies (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus valley should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the tacrolimus valley are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post transplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because tacrolimus is a substance with low clearances, adjustment of the Advagraf-Dosisschema can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - renal transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral adjuvant therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral adjuvant therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosing in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switching from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this change in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose, must be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral starting dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection must begin daily with the recommended oral starting dose.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients, which are converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">In a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and intestinal transplant recipients were used in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with impaired liver function in order to maintain blood cages in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunctions a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatinine levels, a calculation of the creatininine and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full-blood Tacrolimus Talar checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could change the blood concentration of the tacrolimus (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood levels of Tacrolimus in full blood in the first period of liver transplantation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur in consequence of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the induced formulations of Advagraf are still available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a lowering of the tacrolius level in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is to be avoided, or other remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolius concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases Prograf was seen as a cardiomyopathy which can be seen as anterior or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf contains hard capsules, retarded, lactose, patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose-malabsorption are special caution.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolius blood levels with the simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was achieved with antimycoagulants such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, ittraconazole and voriconazole and with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thereby increase the level of hormone exposure, it is especially cautious when taking decisions on contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus could potentially lessen the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it is possible to assume that tacrolimus is not dialysis able.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be conveyed by binding to a cytosolitic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependant inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B-cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism brought about by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This indicates that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly done via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances are used for the treatment and prevention of hemorrhage in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder due to the lack of Factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advantages are used for the treatment of hemorrhages or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Haemophilia A patients suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is introduced which enables it to form the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is produced in a different way so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the drug application was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding episodes with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advances (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advantages may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human scent factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for transferring Advances across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution treatment depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma gas (in% of the standard or I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, adequate determination of the factor VIII plasma gas is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and show different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 I.U. should be given by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be directed to the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulatory activity of Factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates to the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (each 3 patients).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP still evaluated the benefits risk balancing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the ADVATE safety profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, so that the authorisation holder is to apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially distributed the CHMP Committee to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company accepts its application for approval for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breasts, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that has genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene is normally used to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undergrowth, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion has not been sufficiently demonstrated to bring Advexin injections in Li-Fraumeni tumours benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notify the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified active ingredients" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages, caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and older, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be completely taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are abbreviated.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients who took Aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, patients under aerosaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received deslauatadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth-drying, dizziness, psychomotorical hyperactivity (restlessness), insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to deloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from narrow-angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroioia (hypertension), or have a cerebral ischemia (stroke) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transportation of Aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking it or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the absence of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains, the drug is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergoid, dihydrogotamine or other deongestiva, which can be applied perorally or nasally as abusive rhinologic (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, napkin olin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headache) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, hydatical obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the matological tests are carried out, since antihistamines can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with deloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of deloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the loratadin and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether the loratadin was alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a light-headedness, which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, tinnitus, taxonomy, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dryness, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastal cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the Adhemorsmolecular P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined based on the overall score for the symptoms (except the nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than in monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with deloratadin over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to sex, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Within a single dose-study of the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the dispersive application of Aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of a loratadin were badly exchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) from Pseudoephedrine after the sole application of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure to the gift of an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin, however, do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did not have greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicity studies the combination of laurel / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to develop its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosed with the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of Aerinaze: • hypertension • Heart chasing, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache, or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">For use in recommended dosage, it is not expected that Aerinaze leads to light-headedness or reduces the attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulties, whistling breath, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach problems, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, convulsions, liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver values have also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilia for insertion (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in 5 ml syrup or 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by identifying changes in symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, disability of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (number of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at urticaria, the decrease of the symptom scores after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in the placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to deloratadin, lauatadin or any other ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of deloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been terminated and resumed when reappearing.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not identified as part of clinical trials with deloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to light-headedness, which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with deloratadin and at 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose-study, administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the Adhemorozeküls P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical trial with multiple doses, administered over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which deloratadin was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear ducts and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, in other forms of the urticaria it will also lead to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and reducing the number of paddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itch of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with placebo in comparison to 19% of the treated treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and waxes, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, where the patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of deloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of deloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 in vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with a loratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of the loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with lauloratadin and lauatadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and lauatadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin can not detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of the anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have reduced their metabolic rate and experience a higher level of substance (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is yet metabolized, is identical to that of children that metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or saccharase isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius in the recommended dose than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose-study in adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of deslauatadin (nine-fold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an antihistamine treatment received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of deloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of the loratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psychomotor activity.</seg>
<seg id="1780">Clinical pharmacological studies in adults resulted in the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to increase alcohol-induced power hardening nor to increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and reducing the number of paddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolic phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with the syrup formulation of children aged between 2 and 11 with allergic rhinitis that are restricted to metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) through Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of deloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the AUC- and CMAx-values of deslauatadin were compared with pediatric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received deslauatadin syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. was officially notified to the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company accepts its request for approval of Aflunov on the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic outbreak occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have not yet built up immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quickly in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane covering of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a foreign body) was purified, cleaned and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you would like to participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>

<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which is taken together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Asgenerase decreases the HIV amount in the blood when taking in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug used with low dose of Ritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who previously had protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (virus load) or the change in virus load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks, but asgenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, asgenerase also decreased the viral load, but the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who were previously treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16-week treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase combined with Ritonavir increased the viral load after four weeks compared to those who received their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ampavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are degraded in the same way as asgenerase and are detrimental to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take aeriase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (the death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children were outweighed over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacokinetic amplifier ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the transportation of asgenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic boosting of amonavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amdynamoar should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than Amprenavir as capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution for insertion are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dosage for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amonavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the supplanting addition of pritonavir (boosting), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">"" "" "" "Agenerase must not be given at the same time using medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amdynamoar during the intake of amdynamor (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asgenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure in the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asgenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, asgenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously impaired liver function, including chronic hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticosteroids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids and suppressions of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma gas of amdynamoar (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amonavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amdynamor, the patients should therefore be monitored for pick-up symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolage of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hemophilic patients (Type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors have reported an increase in bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial aetiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonectsis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC by Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to balance the degraded plasma seal through a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, very often adverse effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already receiving St. John's wort, the amonade mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amdynamor (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">In contrast, 508% increases, by 30% for CMAX, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with amonavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of amonavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and harmlessness of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreases if prenavir (750 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amdynamor in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of amonavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of prenavir and caletra cannot be given, however, close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was performed to use asgenerase in combination with didanosine, but it is recommended that Didanosine and Agenerase income diverge at least one hour (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with amonavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amonavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin may reduce serum concentrations of amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as delavirine might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma gas.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be carried out, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amonavir and Ritonavir can be difficult on Delavirine.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amonavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with asgenerase, a reduction in dosage of rifabutin will be recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamonavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if used together with asgenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions, associated with these medicines, when used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenerase as it may cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amdynamor may result in a degradation of the plasma gas of amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingestion with asgenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensify the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual impairment and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir received 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, fluoresconal propionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence intervals 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dispensation of asgenerase with ritonavir together with these glucocorticosteroids is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic cortical corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism varies greatly from CYP3A4, pronounced enhancements of the plasma gas are expected at simultaneous administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a habdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amdynamor is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilizing the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amdynamor (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with the orally recorded midazolam (see paragraph 4.3), while conserving with parenteral midazolam at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amdynamor, the patients should therefore be monitored for pick-up symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the reduced reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adjust how the ampavir- dosage is to be adjusted if amdynamor is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the event of simultaneous adoption of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore, alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of asgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats Amprenavir related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether prenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the nistling in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive ability, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenerase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with asgenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of asgenerase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment, or if they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of asgenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4) performed by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of common laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fac fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed under 113 antiretroviral not pretreated persons treated with amdynamor in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, in 245 NRTIs, in 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 patients (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macular papilous nature, with or without itching and stepped up spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with amdynamor had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonectsis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In the case of PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of asgenerase twice daily along with low doses of Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) were similar to the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed in patients who received asgenerase together with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see paragraph 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-pol- pol- proteings with the result of a formation of unmature, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amonavir in vitro to HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amonavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir-based regimens with protease inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Sixteen of 434 antiretroviral-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamranavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 trial represented a four-logical failure by week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients enrolled with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamonavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with virological failure more than 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors occurred:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of amonavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / M / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / S / M / M / M / M / S / T / M / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / T / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S / S.</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amonavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that dispel diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amonavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amonavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamonavir Resistenade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients in which a Fosamprenavir (three out of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), and Taquinavir (four of 24 isolates), appear to call forth (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amonavir reserves its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early failure of a failing treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the PRO30017 study, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults following virological failure (virusload ≥ 1000 copies / ml) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly baked with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was therefore unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amonavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound dynamo representing the active portion is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range from CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2078">In the event of simultaneous adoption of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>

In rare cases, severe local skin irritation has been observed, which made treatment necessary and / or have led to a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, requiring emergency treatment and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">Prior to treatment with other cutaneous warts for the treatment of external warts in the genital and perineal region, Imiquimod-cream has no clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data points to an increased rate of warping deductions in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod-cream has shown less efficacy in this patient group with regard to the removal of cowards.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips or hairline was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or reactions are returned after treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break may be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable therapies should be considered in case of superficient basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs do not present clinical experience, the application for pre-treated tumours is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not investigated for the treatment of actin keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data is available on the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actin keratose on the underarm and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 patients showed a less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immunostimulatory characteristics, Imiquimod cream should be used with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth connection or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2211">The most frequently communicated and likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 patients treated with imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In these studies, the most frequent, probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream, was a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with Imiquimiodine treated patients with actin keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials three-week treatment with Imiquimod-cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excretion / flaps / flaps (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe deformation and encapsulation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies examining the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimiodine, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The most serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to show that the efficacy with regard to complete healing of the cowards was clearly superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the 119 patients treated with Imiquimine the pretzels were completely cured; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% from 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in five-time use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficient basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data available from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimodine at three weeks of application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 of treatment area on the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The first-year results from two combined observation studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications are external pasterns, actin keratose and superficially basal cell carcinoma typically do not occur in paediatric patients and therefore were not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies at the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life was about 10 times higher than the half-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actin keratosis or supernatural basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for dermal application yielded no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for man due to systemic exposure is regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumours performed in the group of mice that were treated with the active-free cream, formerly and in greater numbers than in the control group with inferior UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was measured (by examining its effect on the reduction of the GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">For children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthritis, fever and reactions to the infusion centre.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic response).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information, possibly known, and update this summary where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission approved Genzyme Europe BV to authorise Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Muenolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient performs this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 I / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only occur in an appropriate clinical environment where revitreation facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against larvae, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related response must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment has to be handled with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or medium-severe infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in infusion rates to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to breast milk over breast milk, it is recommended to not quench during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly defined as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory stagnation and visual edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children's undesirable drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe expiry form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion was performed within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment. in patients under 5 years of age, a seroconversion usually occurred within a month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to early retirement from the study) 13 / 45 patients had no antibodies that were detectable by radioimmunopecial (RIP) assay, including 3 patients who had never come to Serocondiversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitor effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and is absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study investigating the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the anticipated value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the absolute footpath in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) had a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the GAG mirrors was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease incidence between the patients, which was taken into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk test, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with the severe form of follow-up and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined after the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of follow-up (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the average follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe follow-up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were carried out on the GAG mirrors in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available, rate annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in a unique dose, toxicity in repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not cause any particular risks to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2343">If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the ingredients of Aldurazyme or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2344">An infusion-related reaction is any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4 "What side effects are possible").</seg>
<seg id="2345">When using aldurazyme with other medicines, please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chloroquin or procaine, because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken, including non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - dilution and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted prior to the application and is intended for IV application (see information for physicians and medical staff).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 I / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions emerged, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence at more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • Joint Diseases, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • elevated heart • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the infusion point</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available, rate annually, and if necessary, the packaging contribution will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it is not stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided that the dilution occurred under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Je according to the body weight of the individual patient first determine the number of hatching cylinders to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic non-small "lung cancer," which does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients previously untreated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (one vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (drug against vomiting) and liquids should be given before or after the application of cisplatin (to prevent a lack of fluid).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, lowered or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetrexed thus slows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetrexed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural pelicom, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived on average 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to docetaxel compared to 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta, had longer survival compared to the comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the publishing market of Alimta in the entire European Union to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V..</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with a ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a 25 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The necessary volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow cylinder and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the first-line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except in overweight plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except in overweight plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours, approximately 30 minutes after completion of the telemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as IV infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the telemetrexed gift and on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of telemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake should be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last telemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week prior to the first telemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created prior to each application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3-fold of the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the Nadir's Nadirs or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be further treated according to indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applied to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (with the exception of neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA has to be aborted if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so on in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies do not show that patients aged 65 years or over 65 years of age have an increased side effects risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dose-adaptations that go beyond the dose-adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3,0-times the upper limit value (in case of metastases of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone-key immunosuppression and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutron count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrality, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-maternal toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees of 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetrexed need to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce the toxicity of treated toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with telemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom a therapy with emetrexed is provided must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-term for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with telemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with a clinically significant liquid buildup in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion is to be considered before the telemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 main cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with telemetrexed if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated lifeline vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be referred to in front of the treatment order to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in a reduced prolonged occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore advisable if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid are applied in high doses in patients with normal renal function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with telemetrexed should be avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data concerning the interaction potential of NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the concurrent application with telemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio), when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- res antimetabolites, serious birth defects are expected in the case of an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy unless necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is caused by emetrexed, men should be informed before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether telemetrexed transfers into breast milk and undesirable effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and were randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2418">Clinically relevant CTC toxicity, which were reported at &lt; 1% (occasionally) of patients who received Pemetrexed, included supraventricular arrhythmias.</seg>
<seg id="2419">Clinically relevant laboratory toxicity Level 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 2 composition of three single Pemetrexed Monotherapies (n = 164), except neutropenia (12.8% compared to 5.3%) and an increase in alanine (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are probably due to differences in patient population, as the Pha- se 2 studies both chemonaive and clearly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests.</seg>

<seg id="2427">From clinical trials patients with telemetrexed treatment occasionally reported cases of colitis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perfo- ration, intestinal necrosis and typhitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">From clinical trials patients with telemetrexed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It has been reported in cases of acute renal failure in telemetrexed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of pneumonitis were reported in patients who were irradiated before, during or after their telemetrexed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by disrupting important, folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetrexed acts as an anti-folate with multiple targets by blocking thyme synthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and purple nucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPERIS, a multi-centric, randomised, single-blind Phase 3 study from ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus Cisplatin in patients with malignant pleural pleura showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage over patients who were treated with cisplatin alone.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was undertaken in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm (randomized and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleural pelicom was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in comparison to the single Cisplatin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a delay of the lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open Phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was a median survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the treatment effect on the overall survival fell in favour of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.61-1.56; 95% CI = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2,26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a randomized, controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for Pemetrexed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pretreatment are similar to docetaxel.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken along with a fat-rich individual meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic check, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma seal was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants combined with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international normalized ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotenes in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional vitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a one-time dose Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a slight decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the medicine, as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side-effects observed after the launch of orlistat is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can cause anxiety with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered three times a day in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases of orlistat overdose reported after the market launch, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dosage of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, a rapid regression of any systemic effects resulting from the locating properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is used in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine due to covalent bonding to the active Serb-rest of the gastric and pankreatic passages.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fatted diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to baseline value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in study who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the biggest loss of weight occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in Gesamtcholesterin cheated with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of LDL cholesterol with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat was 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7. in general, non-metabolic orlistat in the plasma could only be demonstrated sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimal systemic resorbid dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactine) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-shaped leucine group), could be identified which represented nearly 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient contributes to the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alois studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the 24 hours following chemotherapy, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi were not able to vomit (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the 24 hours following chemotherapy, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi were not able to vomit (153 from 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2617">Alois is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required at the same time offering Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with the Qt interval extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron inhibits the activity of the five studied chemotherapy agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical trial showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population analysis, CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Ranitidine, ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafine) have no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events (a total of 633 patients) were observed at a dose of 250 mcg. (a total of 633 patients) who were at least possibly related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy for Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 25mg / m2 of dxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of dagetron (half-life of 7.3 hours) were compared to day 1 without dexamethasone intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg ondansetron receiving intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of trials with chemotherapy-related chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dagetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of preliminary clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repo-isation and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the ECG effects of I.V. arranged Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">After IV administration, an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminological half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-related in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ y / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous injection of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) measured in 11 testicular cancer patients (± SD) increased in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) reached once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to the value measured after a one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after one-time use of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolization have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in palonosetron metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although the terminal elimination period and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron are increased in patients with severe liver dysfunction, a reduction of the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposure, which are considered adequate over the maximum humanistic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical studies, there is evidence that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans) that were given daily over two years led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined for one-time use in humans, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the announcement of approval for the placing of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called" "" "Roferon-A" "" "with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "Reference Rates" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon is intended to be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, liver tissue damages damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) is introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon using Roferon-A (ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed may not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was again flamed in more patients than in the reference doctor's drug; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test conducted in the study investigating the question of the extent to which the medicine receives an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection that is accompanied by crust formation) and small infected lathes (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections proven or believed to be caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the surface to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwangen, about 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (termed cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo billed during short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation due to the use of retapamulin saline, treatment is to be aborted, the ointment should be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retinulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on skilful skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the mean retinulin (AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased after topical application of 1% retinaphine ointment on skewed skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retinulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the effects on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">The reapamulin salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued or the therapy with Altargo continues / stop, the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy should be weighed for.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have been used by Altargo, the most commonly reported side-effect irritation was at the location, which concerned approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from Clitopilus passeckeranus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus) by fermentation.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding point of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data points out that the binding point is involved in ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the ribosomal P-binding area and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide transfer, partially blocking P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the application of Retapamulin at least some types of infection appears questionable due to the local prevalence of resistance, consultation by experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinopathy against S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retinaphine ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and buttoned skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retinopathy of ointment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of peeled skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), carried out over 14 days there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro-examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mice-lymphoma-test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat-microkernel test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dosage of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of peeled skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were found in oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovievance system, as presented in the Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the Agency is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the Module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal Products for human use," the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">To point out irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it was not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice in case discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic zip that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">This is why Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the existing vaccination plan can be terminated in two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refreshing dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines contribute to "teach" the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the Vaccine Added Vaccine, which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 by Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Since the rix and Twinrix adult contain identical contents, some of the data that support the use of Twinet Adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix in a six and 12 month interval between injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matchiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic dimmation with Ambirix is made up of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is requested for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have addressed a Hepatitis A- vaccination need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even when antibodies are no longer detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic response after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units of ininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In patients with hemostalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after the basic dimmation, so that there may be additional doses of other vaccines in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">With thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambirix can be injected as an exception subcutaneous as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambition in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measure- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be deemed to have no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the previous thiomerang and preservative-containing vaccine formation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses have been administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matchiness on a basis basis per accine dose of Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix in 50.7% of subjects, compared to 39.1% in subjects following the dose of a dose of 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who received Ambirix were reported about pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matchedness was comparable to a proband (i.e. across the entire vaccine) with 39.6% of the subjects who got Ambirix compared to 36.2% among the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and matchiness was small and similar to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of ininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported after vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccinations reported via severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine combination with Ambirix, or during the 3-dose vaccine combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of inininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccinations between 1 and 15 years old, the SeroConversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6 dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The SeroConversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotective rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 according to the dose of the 3-dose vaccine compared to Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year old one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-dose vaccine with an ambian or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of ininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of ininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the refresher chimera of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for previous formulation for the current formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspendiation to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus-containing foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted by other means, such as through bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete line of vaccines has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both doses, (though you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest itself through itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child has already an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with an ambian.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective constituents per accine dose (360 ELISA units of a decombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes an ambience of people suffering from severe blood clotting disorders is injected under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened by a disease or a treatment in your body's defences, or if you / your child undergo / undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without spelling) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated or have received immunoglobulins (antibodies) / has or has planned this in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with ambience, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix is not given pregnant or breast-feeding women, unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 disconnected cans): • Pain or discomfort to the insertion site or redness • Maternity • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ often (up to 1 case per 10 debilled dosages): • swelling at the injection point • fever (over 38 ° C) • dizziness • gastrointestinal disorders</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 displaced doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally restricted or extended rashes, which can be itching or blowing, swelling of the eye area and the face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden blood pressure drop and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like ailments, including chills, muscle and joint pain, convulsions, dizziness, missening like tingling and "Ameisensing," multiple sclerosis, disorders of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been known since obtaining the initial approval for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefits-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammontaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonary is - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or via a gastrointestinal tube (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) resp. a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammontaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (i.e. without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammontaps may also lead to loss of appetite, an abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, impotence, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste speech, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammontaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammontaps was" "" "allowed" "" "under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifests form (complete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for the use when there is hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking account of protein intolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early-manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethintrana bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disturbances as there is a risk of the origin of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet of AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and odema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is performed over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) there was a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the breastfeeding period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of the patients had at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorecttic patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate deposit, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity at intravenous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, which is secreted by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram of the sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set early and treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hematalysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitric excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was the survival rate of 100%, but even in those patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with late-manifests form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the orniethintranscarbamylase deficiency), who recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrat for sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the majority of patients with urea cystial disorders (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma gas were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Secretion The drug is excreted through the kidneys within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrat had no adverse effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either orally (infants and children who are not able to swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrointestinal tube or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept inside the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early-manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethintrana bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active Metabolit of Phenylbutyrat) before birth, lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorecttic patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate deposit, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it may be assumed that for each gram, the sodium phenylbutyrat is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the durations of durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring scoop of 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS may also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot secrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stopping" (an anomalous measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medication for preventing blood clots) using the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another antibody) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was frequently used a stent (a short tube which remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was just as effective in terms of all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivaliruine, other harpines or any other ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the market launch of Angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST midrange infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed once again for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a pressure of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a common bolus gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI encroachment is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt must be of 0.3 mg / kg / weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed before use and the body dose should be administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is properly administered.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to PCI (whether treated with bivaliruine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, it is necessary to administer a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and to reconsider the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after receiving the IV administration of unfractional heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other components or against miludine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding caused by a disturbance of the hemostasis and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis-based patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudin is administered in combination with another antibody (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages on arterial spots occur in the case of PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can undergo bleeding during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients taking Warfarin and being treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivaliruine reaches the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregations) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">The combination of bivalent irudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants regulates the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal studies are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debonding, or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to bivaliruine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivaliruine plus GPIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestioning Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalent group and in comparison groups treated with heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently came to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less common than in groups with heparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliddin plus GPIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known hemorrhage, Reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalent group and in comparison groups treated with heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently came to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organics in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinant inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the anion binder region of thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin is slowly splitting the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, Bivalirudin had no thrombocytopenia / heparininduciated thrombocytopenia / heparininduciated thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anti-coagulatory effect, which is supported by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg bivalent irudin was given and infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the ACUITY study, an unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST midrange infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography in 72 hours, were spread evenly across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for the patients receiving Aspirin and Clopiquetry according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopiquine before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double-blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalent irudin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the division of the ARG3 Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination is performed in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a temporal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals in repeated or continuous exposition (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10-fold of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was restricted to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects following long-term physiological stress in response to non-homestostatic coagulation were not observed after short exposure to those in clinical use, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the production of ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter time of activity than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type 2 diabetes, where the body does not affect insulin effectively, was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was diagnosed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lipolysis.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transportation of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneously by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose level and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of activity, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosing or abortion, especially in patients with insulin-requiring diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diopyramid, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of affinity such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanthidin and Reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between intra-linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lupin enters human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are listed in clinical trials known undesirable drug cures, grouped according to system organics and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, moderate hun- ger, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Podystrophy will be foamed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, as a result a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous doses of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially due to skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lucersin the effect occurs faster and the active-time shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin luglisine demonstrated a glucose-lowering effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and a disproportionate rise in the glucose-giving effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosescing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a similar postprandial glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lucersin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lucersin was ingested 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lucsin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin luglisine at a dose of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal begins compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 Min.) before the meal begins (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lute in a dose of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malonic, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the meal begins (figure 1C).</seg>
