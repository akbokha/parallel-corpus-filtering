the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
learn more about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings extensions ... Open the box map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash @-@ module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras drop @-@ off . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available .
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Acc@@ ept@@ ance filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose Extras DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ Element , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps provide the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily recognized if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle that is switched over View color mode can be either a depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for the display or if the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rec@@ tangle .
in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item . it is not always observed in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; frames are drawn to ensure the ne@@ ural entries are no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rec@@ tangle is square .
how parti@@ tioning the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always prefer@@ able to divide areas in such a way that rectang@@ les arise which are as square as possible . the best methods concerning this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can design@@ ate the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View holding the area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . processing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , like &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens to be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; attempts to report problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report . this opens a dialog with a broken link . if you use these short@@ cuts , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all the information you need is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list is spoken English , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to see news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to report in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you have finished editing ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data backup will be saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . digi@@ ti@@ am settings set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; consider each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during the search of the folders you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; Dur@@ ance recur@@ sively list@@ ens to the libr@@ arian in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can be edited &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ um@@ list have no photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and dropping it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can in &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can be digi@@ ti@@ sed ; it may also work with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported blank cameras in the Help menu Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transmission to the computer the camera is often used as a disk device . the connection can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the G@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital cameras . G@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributing software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview pictures of digi@@ p@@ photo@@ 2 . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ ck@@ ups and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complete a function as the changes made in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag@@ ging and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree tree , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type sel@@ ector allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . so filtering on the filen@@ ame only works if this ind symbol view is displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ location dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are sorted in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the allocation properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album im@@ porting screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , you need to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped together under a shared name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by choosing Fol@@ der from the toolbar or sorting images After collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums after date sort .
the buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ tization ; open , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; support the input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list on the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe kno@@ bs in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information on each image is shown below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit via Settings digi@@ ti@@ .@@ Please select the albums page and adjust the preview pictures to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help window , which appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important properties including all keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows an auxiliary window .
albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can choose all the features that were digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slideshow or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by either selecting F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the editing section you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by selecting the right mouse button context menu and selecting the application from the File Type sub@@ menu . the applications listed there will be checked by the &amp; k@@ de ; file assignments for the file type .
you should note that after editing by other image editing programs , you may encounter problems with the metadata included in the picture . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . this way , this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for turning . the simplest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview button and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want a photo of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; delete , it will be moved into the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image deletion or Del If you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last change of the file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch list ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost once and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch &amp; quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keywords . if you want to add a new keyword after you cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be used for sub@@ stit@@ uting this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword may be only once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you want to tag with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate cue word in the tree &amp; quot ; My c@@ itation &amp; quot ; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword as@@ signing them from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords you assign to it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower rec@@ tangle of the selection frame which displays the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
Neb@@ aj@@ ut search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search finds results . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be shown again . if Search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as the search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search will be done . the Save search function will be used to assign a name to My search list . if you want to change your selection after search again , you will need to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit the search , the search form will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select as advanced search , the advanced search dialog will appear to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Clear in the pop @-@ up menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ da@@ ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . all rules are added by line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group or delete them from it . each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to themselves .
similar entries : this is a section in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one . using a sw@@ ell@@ ar , the results can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture somewhere around the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hand @-@ hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; finds the suitable pictures . again , a sw@@ ell@@ tale can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this will of course require your pictures to contain Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats including raw files .
select one or more images from any point in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Light@@ box add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window will open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated console with L Extras .
from the preview window you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area to see . if you select preview from the toolbar and execute the Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then they are also executed with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate pairs from the toolbar , then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas to compare . the right adjacent image will be displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal dele@@ tions work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated field . this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to swivel the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will be shown in the same image area .
use the zoom slider under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image inside and out . this happens in both images if you are the same in the Pre@@ view mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers each part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos takes a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect and use photographs again . we focus on the procedures for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing , archiving , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you do not need to find a certain photo for longer without stock management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use it certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant import of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re @-@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to enable EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data to be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item from the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so &amp; digi@@ kam ; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes available . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an assessment to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at further work .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ arrives ; automatically mount the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging a sub@@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata consists of many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to in@@ scriptions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , you &apos;ll start to see some details , people , the place .
wow ! one starts to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is it to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images simultaneously . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was she not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already countless and will be deep @-@ moving in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical indications . this then displays the photos at the location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information is digi@@ ti@@ zed to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not wanted to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can &apos;t be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author @-@ line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this can be titles such as : employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here , which you provide the image to others . if the image is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify them in the image . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ da@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you need to be treated more cau@@ tious and you may not be trusted for more than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which requires a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliably .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . that is why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control hum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from corrupted disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
slowly start burning with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also , read the media with a description , date &amp; author badge and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ ard study
in short : dispens@@ ers are the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temper@@ tures , the error rate is increased dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure , S@@ MA@@ RT bugs the im@@ min@@ ent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make up a lot of electric shocks , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . at your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause scrat@@ ched key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed Mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and gives the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that also all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the television card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a non @-@ stop power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models permit them to continue working until the current runs again . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with the cost of avoiding it . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be kept for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are refer@@ enced to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies a backup and a distributed memory are included in the offer .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if it happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you should open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard with a GP@@ L compatible license .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . with not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ste@@ els is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to name the most popular file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more deterior@@ ated . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anyone else for data loss . so you often get your data on a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or changing the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you , you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation gap : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a loss of data is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two times : the complete backup and the latest differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snapshot images . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional th@@ inning should happen manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , associate X@@ MP files , retained original memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , using the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert it to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printer for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ gt ; # operates with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
PNG was designed as an open source standard which should replace GIF . it can be much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it needs relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( defl@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a ro@@ yalty free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and oblig@@ ated to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace &amp; quot ; Image resource block@@ quot ; -@@ Technology of the 9@@ 0s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a blend of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores metadata separ@@ atly from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as indicated above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation supporting fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera image , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edited &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed the images again , you should add the metadata again , which may be cut off by other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them into web galleries , en@@ code them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the section Add a photo to an album you will find a description how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database database .
to digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and switch it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a Finish indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as the Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar made of the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All . this downloads all the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are securely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected download button is displayed as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . until now , these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
the list of existing albums is shown , like normal folders sorted , displayed . details for folder sorting can be found in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , using the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select them first and delete selected delete selected .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you should carefully check if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras often use not very meaningful names as file names for the photos . the file names are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the data about the author in the section default auto @-@ identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want another date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do so , turn off the date &amp; time option . for further modifications you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file names , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new filen@@ ame , which has been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used for a photo , is shown below the name the camera provides in preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you next time open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information about the camera orientation at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section of Metad@@ ata tab , you can read more details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is normally turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , you can download the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section of Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , it stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this , you must disable this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is finished , ask &amp; dig@@ ress ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position specified in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it is interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ master ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to store the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and finally through manual entry of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by forwarding the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o mapping module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ defined coordinates that are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not display European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ You need to change the settings dialog from the Settings menu ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for authors : this field should include the photographer &apos;s profession . this can be names such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a closer description on the car field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to provide the indicated picture . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available for other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without loss .
save image identi@@ fiers as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . thus , your cap@@ tions can also be read from other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the option chosen , this information is displayed or not .

the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button to the right of each category .
when you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings can be set if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one then you can get better picture results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the light density than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the PNG compression mode , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the TIFF files option you can comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it does not affect image quality as the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting of Los@@ s@@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react with more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card which was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the highlights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the point lights , so the parts of your images that are burned in , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed white in the settings . use the setting colors to solve some unusual results as it shows the pointed @-@ lights in various ro@@ ses . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the pointed @-@ lights .
this is possible since blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you will be given the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can be adjusted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed image options ; to keep the time for the demo version small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ mo@@ v algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ rap@@ ie provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction as it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information how to translate color information from a color space in the other is to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start .
color profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; check this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not include color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma doesn &apos;t fix for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color @-@ mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore function very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles will fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and picture editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface can &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adjust@@ s the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . other check boxes turn on the metadata that appears at the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera features on the left side show a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right top there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in picture display mode .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set camera models and ports manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option Con@@ fir@@ mation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer you can view &amp; digi@@ switch ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly worked through &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries to apply . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also download the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Welcome Screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; display of the digi@@ key ; under certain circumstances , it speeds up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed the start process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the setting At start looking for new photos forcing &amp; dig@@ ging ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete them from the database .
various color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the item View / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; they may therefore not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it . you can save it with File Save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore from the File menu or using the Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . you can undo the last action by editing undo / restore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the Return or Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made any changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the Tools menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can view this from the digi@@ key ; see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the Print dialog from the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . entire image templates can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Ass@@ ist from the Select Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the Main Window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always performed when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures .
the rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered keyword , allowing you to quickly limit the number of ways to search for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are keyword in the IP@@ TC @-@ box keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the Key@@ word Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - date , keyword and search view is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection .
the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is pulled from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark chamber .
if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow complies with all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image issues are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color gam@@ ut and thus have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB means you have to calibr@@ ate your monitor to s@@ RGB , then you either have to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Auto Ab@@ ility and Con@@ tr@@ ast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
similar : this method adjust@@ s the intensity control factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity canal becomes as flat as possible . sometimes , the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a rest@@ y@@ listing of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo .
the tin@@ plate correction is slightly limited as a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can thus far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values will also be set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons make it exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding rate per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the color management chapter .
another important tool can be found in the color correction menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and also allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool has four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a result of the emergence of a partially developed pressure from a short flash of lightning and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ terr@@ arium ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo . you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too large satur@@ ation . in this case too , the brightness / satur@@ ation tool is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than to increase it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the instrument tone correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the application described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel , or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and that can be shifted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side represents the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controls and pay attention to how the image changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the image settings . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark notes , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ ids .
the three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : this button automatically sets the image values depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and later loaded . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been taken with a digital camera , linear mode usually creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the light notes , you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are dark@@ er .
when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line appears on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for that is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digital channel mixer of the digi@@ cam ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photo .
the Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ours channel mixer for image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Mon@@ och@@ rome . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . far@@ brau@@ schen consists of small art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . preserve the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown at ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstract capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all the scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of le@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a squ@@ am@@ ate . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sc@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tri@@ dimensional texture of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect is applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed item ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ cam ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to retain his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image . passing through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool according to aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into one image at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool sten@@ cil you can put a template across a picture .
the Menu image Tem@@ plate App@@ ly in the image editing can be used to lay templates over an image .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil to the digi@@ cam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
once the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the preview pane of templates .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button will shrink the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the image and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has assets in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional sharpen@@ ing tool . it is very fast and easy , but it produces fine gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture more shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ otrop@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process requires colours with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to sharp edges becoming a bit blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras typically require more subsequent sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers turn a field of focus while reading the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can invoke the sharp@@ ness with the menu entry .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . generally , the most suitable technique for the sharpen@@ ing of an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can reach it via the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting . under re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ t@@ mark with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ focus mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window will show the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats will create close to sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined thus for an edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft transition between the tones are excluded from the sharpen@@ ing and thus fin@@ ish@@ ly errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ terung . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ terung . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focusing mostly reaches better results than blur@@ red .
the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases the FI@@ R Vienna in@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is actually very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
circular focus : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value 1 should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ atal sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos; sch is . in most cases , you should have this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non @-@ non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the edge @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ atal sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations will not immediately visible changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ har@@ sh@@ ly mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna Filter , it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese Filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of obtaining sharp@@ ness in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the Smo@@ oth knob sets the sharp@@ ness of the area dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
direction @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only smooth@@ es in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ulation or CCD sli@@ pp@@ ies , a high value will generate wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create an &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : specifies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular step @-@ step since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step size in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal , but it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to leave it out .
the Save as and Load buttons make it exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
image errors are comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and carry a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is an unusual black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that was caused by a bad film deposit during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can damage the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller defects cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward in order to detect lamp changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and his@@ sing or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise cannot be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the light density tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas typically consuming more . however , it also conce@@ als the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter range responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it can be too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear at the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than sharp@@ ens a picture . use tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ t@@ mark with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ tly sof@@ ten and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove gau@@ ze &apos;s noise , movie gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images . smo@@ othing takes place along the image contours and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and carry a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures are reduced to an old color photograph , which has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown at ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hot@@ pixel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the Dark Picture button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically load it again in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting comp@@ ot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with Center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as there would otherwise be blur@@ ring effects caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction does the transformation with a center filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with aperture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction decreases the brightness of pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ation of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the gra@@ ding correction on one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth slider correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the fourth degree of distortion . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite signature of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image dimin@@ ishes .
brigh@@ tening : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next startup .
the correct correction should be performed first . if you want to re @-@ cut an image and then perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would appear to be false .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove it with the tri@@ mming tool in the menu Trans@@ Cut trim from the image editing or through the zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown at ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the Pre@@ view you can set two parameters of movie gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Ad@@ joining movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel , it makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the digital filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the shot effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image acqu@@ ires a timeless ambi@@ ance released from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the movie effect effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil painting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil painting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and styli@@ stic life are good for this effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two kno@@ bs exist to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . the lines whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to sketch you . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default values of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digital filter engra@@ ver shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digital filter is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ r : blur@@ rings the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ rings the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ rings the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ry of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera .
blur@@ ring bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
she@@ a@@ thing sharp@@ ness : blur@@ rings the image through a random shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image .
you can play with the digi@@ cam ; image editing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the right direction .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the size of the tool . choose Transform@@ ers size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the size of the tool using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with better quality , try to blow up the tool .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create an &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge every single shot for photo , can be saved as a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can blow up an example of photo bubbles by magni@@ fying a small color image to twice size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear aug@@ mentation for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently executed operation but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ tangle . you will see this rec@@ tangle when you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . a new rec@@ tangle will create by simply using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The tri@@ mming button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save or File Save As menu in the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the preview section you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of the height and the trans@@ verse @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to center the selection horizontally or vertically .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible depending on the selected relationship and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed tri@@ angles are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings allow you to hide help so that you can get your pictures together better . these help are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmonic Tri@@ angle : harmonious pitches are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party gel , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle in a similar harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden mean : the golden centre is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to the sum of their two progres@@ ses . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean .
the golden center provides more li@@ que@@ fied guides if you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . in contrast to the third gel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the observer &apos;s gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to guide the golden spiral . it should be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above . their ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal angles . diag@@ on@@ als can be placed on these lines .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic part .
with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it easily happens that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose Transform@@ ers Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ers crop cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option leaves the picture a little bit after the rotation . but keep in mind the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region .
turn right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed region .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
right bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
once you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation crop cut out of the image processing .
a horizontal she@@ ar for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
she@@ ar your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can narrow horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line will be displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the she@@ ar tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two form@@ ulations generating double so much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has some nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation crop cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write about image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give here a list of all the file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this happens based on the extension of the file and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . in the configuration section you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . thereby redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter from &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the configuration section you will find further information about how to use the digi@@ ti@@ zed modules .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which has been in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; it supports more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are commonly used in avi or m@@ peg format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; however , is not a film editor and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playing .

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; contain . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ t@@ marks , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , Un@@ focus mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically Share without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this will of course require your pictures to contain Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallet files that are supplied by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and la@@ stly used colors .
in the Load Palette dialog you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders according to files .
the cursor is shown as a line in the Pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it displays the color next to it . the color is described in the pallet view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box C@@ ursor is enabled under the color button , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ written . you can set this mode by selecting the over@@ write panel under the cursor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end marker , if another color follows . if so , three numbers in the clip@@ board can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color cho@@ oser can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ .@@ The &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; ren@@ ews the graph again and in &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or graph in &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and one h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . needs are needed in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or choose this position automatically .
using the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can make the menu item Settings k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; setup ... see also .
if you want to open a graph@@ ene file outside of a running &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; instance ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the portions of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ ene without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at any start afterwards .
the context menu , which appears normally by clicking in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directional graphs . the algorithm determines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ structured graphs . it produces representations according to the jumping model model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm creates a jumping spring model for un@@ lighted graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man pure gold he@@ ur@@ istic , and includes a lat@@ ch for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source like e.g. Video Stre@@ ams . to do this , you have to have k@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item pictures open a dialog which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears as you can replace the default values duc@@ c@@ row to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner .
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after scanning the button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window for setting the options of the target image appears . please remember that type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create it by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the screen shot in the Import menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have picked up the complete desktop , just read the window under the mouse .
the delay controls how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay up enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the Options dialog will appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send his photos to the people who are important . you can display your favorite photos of the world , place photos of your camera &apos;s phone online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful login , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module is launched to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current permissions that the module displays . to upload , you will need write permission . the module currently supports no other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the Add Photos button should be pressed once you have all other options set . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as tags during the upload .
the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options allow you to set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the change option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alisation provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alisation cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS lane .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog will appear . in order to perform a possible correlation between time and localization , you need to load a track file with a GP@@ X file .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that displays the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the deviation there@@ under the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add them to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a localization is in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relative to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog turns the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
select the region and enlarge it . always select the region in question and increase it again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to mount the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ tool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages con@@ forming to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 in order to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
this module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture creates a page , a new page opens in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show ,
the Album will define the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with Other color depth you can change the default color depth . this of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser is automatically started in the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and past@@ es . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a win@@ dow@@ ed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. in the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client module is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the Metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . for burning the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that you can start generating the module using Extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that displays an image . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set up next . in case of doubt you should let it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the output file .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your preferences , you can start with the coding button to start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings button at the bottom right corner .
the printing assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RAW file into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not effect any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all information on your image and uses the los@@ sy LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before wor@@ sen@@ ing the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images on an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending upon image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ ize in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional scale variation in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the picture window will appear with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the Add Images menu with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ove Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t be sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after adding comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best suited to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original JPEG format files , then the original source is added to the images to be sent .
when the process is done , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button closing , you can close this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL Output option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant picture transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option filen@@ ame indicates that the file name of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select to show the images in a random order . so it will not be used the order of the pictures in the album .
between the images , the temporal distance between the pictures can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect from each transition between the pictures .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the background image of the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined .
to view images next to the names , select the button on the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to select which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the image should be displayed or cut .
when you visit the Find dialog in the main window , you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again in the image .
if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data stat@@ s about the pictures in your database .
each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview window ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate to the preview pane .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview view .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description which will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . you will find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically explained .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download any pictures , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder you have to manually copy them to it . for the import function , see , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have moved all three to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you may want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time for it , you will need to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and import .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external ones . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a short@@ cut to pictures . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all images together and share this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL that you specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you want to copy Man@@ ually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album with the Automati@@ cally option to the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be up to 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu Import ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the Im@@ porting Wizard consists of four steps . first you have to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folders the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called to your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories these are in your database .
the fourth step allows you to compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside several picture groups . if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see an image with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently it also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file in the upper@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. , normal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; note the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
using the menu entry , Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , the different settings options will be explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings for the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog you can set up entire members groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can access via the modules themselves .
because the modules are shared by several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . therefore , you should always test new modules with the Demo Database before you access them on your own pictures . you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ init@@ .exe \ &gt; or over the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that share the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums : this is an album just a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
in doing so , it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , is all the pictures that shows you the picture preview currently .
in addition to the current album , I have to add a list of albums to the modules . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category that you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , you will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so whether you would have chosen persons to view and pass on this to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , see above a menu and a toolbar . under the toolbar you will see the window that you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain much information since you have not yet entered information about your images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the image , where the image has been taken , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously .
all of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by means of that the names used are moved up , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the S@@ ort button on the date below the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the buttons before and back , which are under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
the picture shows a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that this is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you would like to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the image .
if you select the image in your browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have no filter set . an example of this can be found here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the removal button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will appear which you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images anywhere , so you can record the pictures somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the image from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 you can view the thumb@@ nails . however , you can not view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now to ask for inser@@ ting the respective CD . so if you want to avoid trouble , such as the jum@@ pr@@ ing of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you accessible to others and click on the current view lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that your little sister may see , navigate and lock the menu item all except current view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your younger sister , simply select the menu entry to lock pictures , thus removing all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered in order to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password change in the privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to avoid the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start it from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and lay somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether you want information at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the info box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries on this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image below and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing C@@ trl key and Plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . the Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ tangle is marked and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the sole key sets the zoom so that each pixel matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they come in and out with the plus and minus button .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can ann@@ ot@@ ations to the current image with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can see the ab@@ ort and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the picture and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pushing the corresponding letter . in the picture you can see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
this is described in detail . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to display categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the image .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . the way you can undo your painted later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the Object Tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar , or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop down menu is displayed for you to choose the correct position :
delete selected objects from the scene using del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have modified properties , click App@@ ly to take over those changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly again or reject the Cancel changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross will appear in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility stage of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level of the scene selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window rules or if you need another configuration , you can set them as you like . you can also save multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the path to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the path to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the tap into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card @-@ card @-@ riders at the top of the view .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the tap on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the connection bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position .
the current window view can save you with view window arrangement ... store . it displays a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ ders icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar , or choose the menu entry View scene .
a rendering mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender Mo@@ di , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is useful a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image edit to render into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lights . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super sampling frequency refers to neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split again and again and Adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 additional pixels will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually tra@@ cked and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; Import scene , select the Import Menu File Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , it supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this inserts the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with Copy and Pa@@ ste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , opens and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place here the path to your document retention and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object start of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a better wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can specify the depth and threshold values in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can modify existing window frames or create new window arrangements . in the section window rules , explains how to create and save window orders .
drop down drop down menu : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the Add Exist@@ ing Window Order displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
new column creates a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ ors the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map card view together with the previous view and floating , the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu entry . thus you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create . in particular , note that in the fourth wireless model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry called Camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points where you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when pressing the App@@ ly button or the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert end@@ ly body qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a complicated method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now displays the plane , even though at the moment only as fin@@ ite fin@@ ite layer . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property image ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button you will see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the Pig@@ ment Pre@@ view shows only a matte black material because you have to enter Settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time by clicking on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then invoke the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree always choose mon@@ och@@ rome and change the colors in the view of the properties :
you should already be able to execute this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . the ball can be easily created as simple as the floor :
in the view of the properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has contact with the bottom . otherwise , the ball would float above the bottom as you moved the bottom around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First Property and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on the pigment button , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even when metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to produce a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and refrac@@ ts the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog work . thus , the scene is processed pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last svn command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to change default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Configuration &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie dialog , there are five learning flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loading &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next startup opens and c@@ ops show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window mode is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can add &amp; ku@@ k show ; set up just a few of the file types that the program can display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the image by 10 % . the factor is referring to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; image editing based on the digi@@ cam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ shot ; make it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu will contain reports to you with problems or desires . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to provide you with questions to other users of your show@@ room ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , so you should be able to speak this language .
the best start to take part in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ shot ; to access these settings , you need to set in the menu settings show@@ photo ; you can change the settings dialog in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the exposure indicator , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to view . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions for the selected pictures . you can also view the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer can be scanned and stored as pictures .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer can be scanned and stored as images . &amp; sz@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image to save a dialog for saving or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner has been specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel and Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options in particular .
in order to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the entire preview will fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings selected , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the same @-@ name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be checked .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images store . open dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored at option Save without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix , each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button will start K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting Global keyboard short@@ cuts ... selecting with the right mouse button in the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , most of which are also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all necessary modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Res@@ in require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
the scripts / templates folder contains a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to run external programs and commands . usually , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . in addition strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Sets the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change Sign@@ als that a new piece is picked up . the script could now be used with D@@ CO@@ P functions for further information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ izing : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le will also be passed to allow the script to use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; exit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .@@ tar@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with a command of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok Categ@@ ory ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have a few play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew !
usually you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please tell them in the mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be enabled or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be satisfied so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several learning flash@@ cards for setting up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is disabled , only the playlist window is displayed .
use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches on the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
store mood files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible during play change causes the playlist window to scroll / un@@ roll to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
when changing to the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set by selecting Custom Writ@@ ing the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Select Custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector enabled below for foreground and background color .
resume playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last end .
the On @-@ Screen Display sub @-@ window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to display the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers enable even more settings in this card .
the map card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to specify how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the check@@ ers and their sub@@ folders to music .
monitor changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders upon changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , additional equipment is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card bla@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send off played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can see the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes while editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ Info , but not flag@@ ged as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the Status bar ( Access mode / Re@@ play / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are easily forgotten . please note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting displays its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether Amar@@ ok will use the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first .
most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for looking for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist will appear . how do music tracks get there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the playlist needs to be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new rating column to set the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the Sh@@ ort@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then choose from Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and drop it there , just as you would like to do with other files . that &apos;s the simple one : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is located . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual issue must be supported by G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 Dec@@ or can be supplied with the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , enter key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s as of : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device needs to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio . this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. , sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia sound system . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next item of FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error report . increasing the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia fully to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less beams react the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . follow the registration register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download Free Download , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer folder ( you will find the module folder with the command @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again .
please report this to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and execute with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get to know the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , res@@ izing window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click order into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the Control bar system section ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically this adjust@@ s the previous rating with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : selecting Review or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the valuation in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Set@@ ting Set@@ ting Set@@ ting up ... and take the desired changes there .

the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and a password . audi@@ ob@@ liter@@ ator is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please have the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that separates the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without shr@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when comp@@ iling Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message there is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ q is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ der .
you will get the bug There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then execute it as System Administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ t@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug k@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } c@@ t@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the configuration dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output is on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . you are welcome to take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new much @-@ needed main@@ tain@@ er for arts : )

the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist itself is easy to use and yet even for advanced users .
the context Browser shows various information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window will be dropped . the information presented there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information can also be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and the last time and its rating .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be located in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tag .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorites of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , album of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual sections to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text below , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . to do so , no running text script is needed .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com for the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group interpre@@ ts - only grouped the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there will be another split after the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous performers .
group interpre@@ ts / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this could take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it acts in the list view as well as in the tree view . you can find hints about using this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year . of course , you can also select your entire collection , which makes the filter practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - This displays the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces into play in the currently valid order .
app@@ end to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name to save the list .
transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this performer / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for pieces information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files into the garbage bin@@ s ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under Vari@@ ous performers .
undo the compilation - Change a selected album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be shown in different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the playlist browser makes it easy to handle a lot of play@@ lists , including smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Intelligent Play@@ lists are possible . click on Add Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . there , you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter , sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click App@@ ly . this way , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transfer is finished , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and lo@@ osen the disk binding for your iPod .
under the toolbar there is a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a entered URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist becomes longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping down . in that case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter characters there will only appear the pieces that contain the characters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you type in between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination ) .
if you want to search for entries containing whit@@ esp@@ ace , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you may also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this looks for all the pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . to the right you will find play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists , and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , expanded analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the Player Window using the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and setting up toolbar buttons ... Select .
the Status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status of random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking twice in the respective display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . over this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
this entry hides a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to see in the cover administration . select :
the queu@@ es administration received your big collection in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already given ( the details to set up the play@@ lists later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ osc@@ anner ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pres@@ et modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the featured playlist starts with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next batch change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated .
the New button re@@ stores the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . playlist Edit opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece of it in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed while respecting play@@ lists .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one play can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , you will add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want to play .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open in which you can choose a script package for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information to write your own scripts , please refer to the Write section section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization @-@ Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start should show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , create an audio CD . in order to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ encoding bit@@ rate to MP3 , you don &apos;t matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source disc into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog which looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copy process . once reading the original into the image file is finished , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ or@@ - und En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . using ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD afterwards .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces play differently loud .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start the CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Save dialog box will display where you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen , you can then choose between Save and Chan@@ ges . you can also inter@@ rupt the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project is asked what to do with it , as if you had called File Sch@@ är .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the Burn dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD @-@ project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you get files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this function only causes an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image of a CD that you can then burn sometime later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn sometime later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying dialog . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog will not yet have to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , which allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , eliminating the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted , and this dialog box will help you . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and trim black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar at the bottom of the window will appear . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the keyboard assignment below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work straight away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task is crucial , which of the contribut@@ ors you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features that all have in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) void SQ@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ ress@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void Ren@@ ame It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void Ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void @-@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many coding that enco@@ ded those wa@@ v files ( these Ko@@ di@@ ver packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on your computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ress into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or even in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if it is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . all these programs are generally available for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ ver packages need to be installed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about encoder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read off the audio data from the CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass some copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device b@@ ypass the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid buying a copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , later the daily approach to reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface through which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
convert to many formats - depending on which co@@ dec programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must be established first . )
starts reading and - when an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup file - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default . it is to be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main Setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different learning flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information with data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG , lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo devices . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see the &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should generally provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has a very high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression ratio about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate app . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car oster@@ ol@@ ers . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ stated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size , select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information retri@@ eved manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; parameters that can be needed ( = button in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / input the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information which is publicly available on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; is active to select an address ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this way of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirr@@ ored servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save songs from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this has not happened yet .
for saving the read @-@ out wa@@ v files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ n@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) are on the tab for setting up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the co@@ dec can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ dec . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ver is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a encoder , you can receive further information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ n@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check , if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; please check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 video keywords ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , as it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory is / usr / share / cd and that you have write permissions ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably only done once , and
the second section describes how to read a CD ; what needs to be repeated for each CD you want to read .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the right settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program , so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device identi@@ fier of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will be left and entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information ask for information so that you will be informed if information for creating keyword ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b host .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during read @-@ out of the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries from it . the directory or file name is changed with the order name &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ gers .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set it as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server in your area . on this path the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously dischar@@ ging pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so just try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something needs to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi audio systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Tags may also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later modification of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously encoding WAV files : with a dual core or square or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than a wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet will be built up , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; write .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots show a little different from the data fet@@ ched for a CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b logged data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will refer to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this is only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , check the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; Succ@@ ess@@ fully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces have already been filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tag , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; take a look at the &apos; basic settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor anytime . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line activ@@ ates the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at a time .
if you click on the Sel@@ ection button to read out the read @-@ out process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out .
click on the orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the toolbar buttons .
this is the window to control jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error when trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been enco@@ ded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with performance @-@ saving machines , the result is unclear . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the CVS repository . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important package . if you are reading this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is directed to people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be customized to suit your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various learning flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended to do something useful or change it . at least after making contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you have succeeded in obtaining the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real time up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of lyrics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the toolbar , select the Play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start when you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essively . )
when &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and running it back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ Sheet and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically detected , which a song uses , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to set a type of event , select the menu preferences or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played by the row . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection is not saved . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add button . it will again appear the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then add the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu pick @-@ up of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next Song button , next song entry from the menu item , or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the previous item , previous item from the menu item , or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map implements General MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always lets a trumpet sound when playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary transform@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except for the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ in P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you will see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this topic describes how General MIDI &apos;s patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all notes that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant where every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ate instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some keyboard boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . usage is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
keywords are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the included keywords .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and the second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined with the name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch bench@@ marking with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no decim@@ al comm@@ as .
this setting is needed because GM for@@ gives that a keyboard , which receives a pitch bench@@ marking event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key boards are trying to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the View Channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; so on ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
do not forget to activate automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) . in this way , when the collection is finished or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to listen to a file fast , without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. but first you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ M . your temporary collection then contains exactly that one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; MÃ ¡ laga ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as a hobby I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that only appears when information is to be returned .
it is possible to store the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are being played after each other , you should use the category Continu@@ ous Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy of hierarch@@ ies . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; S@@ MB ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to choose play@@ lists from the same menu and either select Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left , or a different group is selected without having to match the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end of the animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; smil@@ ey ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; In@@ g ; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / l@@ gt ; / lt ; / lt ; / l@@ gt ; / l@@ gt ; / l@@ gt ; / l@@ gt ; / l@@ gt ; / l@@ gt ; / etc .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special video embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash must be specified in the Direc@@ tor@@ dialog File Or@@ ders of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to always use a given back@@ end for a particular type of mim@@ e ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV the device and TV channels need to be configured . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog will be used in Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a DV@@ B in it .
because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be operational . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , S@@ MB uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ resource , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ resource .
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when playing from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does every time my CPU has to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; kill .
latex ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems are likely to be used on package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow for easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box ; -@@ website should be made .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ; or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all the &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within that a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; latex programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ates ; and to know its possibilities , the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; Start .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a La@@ ie ( in@@ lay ) &amp; latex can be used ; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; latex is given ; it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master correctly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ ary@@ class , which begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be re @-@ closed using the \ \ end { document } command .
the Quick Start Ass@@ ist of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for the creation of the document . some adjustments may also be made to the document .
document classes : this lists the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , film &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom defined .
coding : the encoding of the encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be he@@ eded ( for the correct processing of the &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex . for integration they must only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document categories of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in order to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use when creating German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . this is a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see green areas of a green text on the screen , it &apos;s with great likel@@ ihood that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and anger through the high@@ lighting .
with automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to read the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu folder ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files , the search search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; more &#93; independent file ( d V ice I n@@ ection file ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the common output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the method search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source text is cli@@ cked . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding point becomes available in the DVI ; viewer .
master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be configured to project project settings .
quick engineering : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be on the front side , and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction .
when viewing the editing toolbar , the three large selection fields should be stri@@ pped . the selection panels have been developed for fast integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection field Ano@@ ther feature is for inser@@ ting articles such as tags , notes or references . the possibilities available are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection field ) .
when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ø@@ e is used for determining the font size . you can specify the font sizes for the main text , the notes nodes , etc . there are the following font sizes available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ ary@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if font sizes are not specified at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the button quick engineering .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically execute the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using rapid construction , it should be automatically started . if this is not the case , logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then add the alteration of the font size within the environment .
the changes are taken only within the environment ( from \ \ begin to environment } until \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in the fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem to the application should be used to see the differences in these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) by printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source code has been created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the preferred search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this just have to set up Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... tools build @-@ out .
to carry out the pre@@ face search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a row of the source code and then cli@@ cked on pre@@ face search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; latex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; Set up as text editor ( Set up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error in using the Quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; if an error occurred , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file contains the source code in the source code . in the editor you can then click the Pre@@ cious La@@ Te@@ X errors and the La@@ Te@@ X errors for spr@@ int between the errors . in order to view the correct line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the correct line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button on the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document . more information on this can be found in the section .
multi@@ level users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Settings General set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ ware &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated insertion of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , you can then paste your own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any and latex ; files can be created . if an easy way to create a template is desired , one should search for one on the Internet and be carried out under the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ates ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ates ; can be made directly from the menu .
to learn more about K@@ ate and its possibilities , the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le can start working directly with the Editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly with reading the chapter .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that this way , when you click \ \ par , \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par .
when drag@@ ging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source texts . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can include additional jump marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu items or the respective ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a sign .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offering excellent possibilities , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code is added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit select the following commands for text selection include :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extension refers not to a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code .
the word exec@@ utes under the current cursor position . this selection also has an expanded meaning , as this command also appears as latex ; -@@ commands with an extra layer ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ates ; offers the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . by editing , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under the editing environment for a very simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is located before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview over can be lost quickly . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under the Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the working environment .
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded bracket .
if the cursor above or behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly cur@@ ly cur@@ ly braces , the overview can quickly be lost . this command del@@ etes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple calls are used as G@@ Ã ¤ se@@ ye . for the practical implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple calls is used . also for the end of the application the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and has two closing coupling signs for &amp; latex .
this automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there may also be language specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , so that German or French suits can be used . there are also many other languages available .
pressing Shift ; Enter an Enter key ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is in a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but also the command \ \ item .
in a table environment , GE@@ T &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjoining line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab@@ l@@ ator in the underlying line . although this tab is not the corresponding one , add &amp; kill ; some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ates ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; to add special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . three different modes are built for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Ki@@ le ... fully supported .
at the beginning a new environment will begin with the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , unfortunately , the complete list is hidden . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively von &amp; Ki@@ le can also be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions can be enabled by editing ho@@ ck marks , and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; full @-@ time settings can be made to these lists . it can be selected various W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ istics for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ statements as well as owners of the general language @-@ use .
command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there will always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the exec@@ utable mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the surroundings are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for complete destruction of environments .
when calling the Compl@@ et@@ ate mode over the menu modified environment or the key of the Alt + Shift key , the command will be automatically inserted and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient performance can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input button .
after this has been done , the environment will be closed automatically once again . as soon as it detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be inserted .

the graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be followed and taken into account .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then be converted to a PDF file using ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to enable the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped together in the menus , comp@@ iling , converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used to Alt ; 2 . then , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and treated using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the Men@@ Ã ¼ project Neues Projekt .... Hier@@ bei will ask the following information for the project :
when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first you have to say that the scope of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
a complete description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; -@@ statements contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; provided , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; Ki@@ le ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package name or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or holding the space key opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor , available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ similar systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , thus creating &amp; ki@@ cking ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be dri@@ lled .
much thanks to those who are striving for the continuity of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project , and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools we all can use under consideration of the GNU / GNU license .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation is known for me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s add it a bit , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML processor and done !
this application requires a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in a w@@ ant@@ y working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of another folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted each time if my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the recently opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then leave the current file simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick from the current file and select the file to be checked using another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the well @-@ formed check option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; given in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , laugh , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug @-@ ins contained and add new . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location , and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often several people work on one project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and notes . see for more information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the team members : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , so that later on , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that launches a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event Configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . addressing can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such leaders will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes to enter is simple . either the note entry is selected from the editor &apos;s context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keywords are entered in a comment field followed by a comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the introduced nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Leader according to field and sub @-@ project leaders should be given the appropriate area or sub @-@ project names as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including auto @-@ completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
upper@@ case / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : big / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
optional Tags automatically close : if checked , will be added for tags for which the closing tag is optional , immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
starting and ending tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . using the Control Panel , the default settings can be restored .
standard drawing encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise open files ( where encoding the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a flash@@ card ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings to the standard back at the next startup is useful when the user interface is confused by changing M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning al@@ erts area serves the tax of the possibility to turn off the display of warnings by hook of no more ques@@ tioning .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be used to specify the ad of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the representation of par@@ ser nodes in the document can be set into details .
mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ ture Tree Configuration , the visibility of nodes in the tree can be set automatically when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ WC abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications of third party , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is given to the plugin during startup , so it can open the current file , the respective folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only read @-@ read parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is checked , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new developed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept has been implemented which allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations about plug@@ ins .
at present , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ U@@ I :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . normally appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower D@@ ock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case , no attention must be paid to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session Start the session . close the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate the running according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , execution will continue .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution will continue .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger implements the next instruction in the script , where it is possible to clean@@ se functions and include into error .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if it were not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to use and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error .
tag files are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type over itself nothing else .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common @-@ attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to each other tag . ( only family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to obtain source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group the elements of a list . it may occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of items that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a more dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following example , for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the schema &gt; schema from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by editing a &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D Speci@@ fication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... clicking on New action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User @-@ defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on this it is not limited ) , which modify the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the selection box input can be determined what to send to the standard input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the default output . it can be specified what to do with the text written to the default output by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to specify actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan how to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit Day &quot; if available , so that an entry when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Print more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size from another .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually as los , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this icon will insert a &amp; lt ; start@@ d ; tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions specify ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , functions to the toolbar , or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar to set the dialog over Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I &apos;ll select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after real@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will be ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , repository , if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations , e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag 1 = Sunday 1.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag 3 = day 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
notice the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the Table of Cont@@ ents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and , consequently , at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; the folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the doc@@ r@@ c file that serves to design the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the Cont@@ ext@@ List ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation was used to use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send by email , send the toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download them . the contributions are checked and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a contribution to this , we recommend to sign the resources for which it uses a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the future users .
in the Upload dialog you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog you will have to enter the input fields ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) and by clicking OK the upload will be started .
the upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar , toolbar , and start @-@ up menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ ver@@ ting of a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog will appear :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ t@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to bring these concepts closer to them without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . from tool@@ bars of actions everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that it can only be used by the user .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please hit in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all the tab@@ s , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with respect to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and corresponding user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this straight added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and strip them . in the representation with learning flash@@ ers stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree view .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu shown .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire website , etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates are only available for the appropriate user and template in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands will appear with respect to the navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree sizes . it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the modification of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts which are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; for that .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developing what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; ru@@ mor is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers reli@@ ed the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; write , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and whit@@ esp@@ ace in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script output error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and turning of the problem re@@ porter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the column @-@ column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries preceding or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filen@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file extension .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that enables , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods will depend on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manages the project . in the section &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained .
load a project toolbar . these are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions need to specify actions by setting actions ... Tool@@ bars will be saved by toolbar factory tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ) team , so that the toolbar will be available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . own description format .
load / refresh entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this globally and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
this activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . inser@@ ting by means of toolbar will refuse , if that day contradic@@ ts the rules at this location .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above menu items . click on them . click an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the current version .
sel@@ ects the type of line ending identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ gg@@ les the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affects any application that the K@@ HTML @-@ Part can use , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
specifies the behavior of the editor window . in the &amp; k@@ ate documentation , you will find details .
a dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or which ones can be added and the sequences can change .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.@@ g foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . on server side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be ha@@ unted if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t get the hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a detailed selection of goo@@ dies .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by An@@ gle or , by removing the tick , clips off the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties menu in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . in order to read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub @-@ window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by showing its own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the Event Configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously certain event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , opens and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the File menu or the Symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu which can be found with the right mouse button :
here you can select various profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile left , the button is hidden to prevent removal .
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk will not be questioned .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be shown :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear of fear , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply swa@@ ying the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via the toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best cle@@ av@@ ed over the toolbar . use and add differ . adding to@@ oling bars is treated at the bottom of the Add tool bar section .
the toolbar and the icons on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , and other actions such as toolbar will be removed , which can be specified in the dialog where you can specify what actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , additional entries are removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Set@@ ting tool@@ bars ... and setting actions can be set .
templates are basically the document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary templates are inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special documents are written in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment about a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are available in template @-@ tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As a local template .
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save option as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged and dropped to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as drag and drop or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or fil@@ esystem .
you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files , create a name for the template and back up . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal oriented approach . you can pre @-@ paste header lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically connect to &amp; PHP ; design , insert files , or link them with them . additionally , you can keep a lot of things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the Sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the template folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog will appear :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded once el@@ ter@@ al attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template view . if a regular folder would be set up , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
this might be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , and by copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation can already be equipped with the right he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source editor into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ site and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is active , this mode is already active , offset the active cursor from a window to the other , with the position in the document being retained .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; view you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow .
let &apos;s assume that you want to change the title of the web page , so you can choose the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this can be used to reduce the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to integrate an external CSS style template by pressing the Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cursor can be used as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting using the back button or the distance key .
the insertion of tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other anch@@ oring tag must be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the table assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled . they will later be in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other styles of style , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be traced .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; compile successfully , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , wa@@ sted support points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a file name without path name . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style file filen@@ ame loaded with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a pres@@ age called QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be expanded according to the rules specified in the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be test@@ 1 ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a checked stop point must be terminated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people operate independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result to be expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; when merging the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ d , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ .
if all files have the same name but are located in different folders then you can make the typing work easier by completely writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder
open dialog allows for manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialog records your selection and displays them next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
using the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
if a merge is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; load them and then compare them . now you can copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed over the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one can see the color of which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merging ) .
on the left of the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines . if the line change is activated , the line is shown with dotted lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the output output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it already contains text by automatic merging already , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict of manually resolved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in case you change your mind and perhaps select another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the results window . carefully proceed with this function .
note : if the sources choose to ignore the options or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate up mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , side , side , end , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs .
you can also use the other buttons to edit in the output window . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insertion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ bottom / C@@ trl @-@ top ) , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture For@@ ward / C@@ trl @-@ Image Ab@@ le ) or the next / previous conflict . therefore , differences between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you have to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if enabled , copy whatever you select , automatically copy to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . however , be careful with this option as you may acci@@ dentally over@@ write the clip@@ board content .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ spr@@ int character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use auto @-@ return line + new@@ spr@@ int \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when shut@@ down and restored at the next startup . ( menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ disable 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ eri@@ ed . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically puts an odd color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the previous line ind@@ entation will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be copied to the clip@@ board automatically . the manual copy to the clip@@ board will then be removed .
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; first , find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when merging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others save only a new@@ line slot &apos; \ &apos; . usually , if this option is enabled , this option may be visible in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but if this option is enabled , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
this option is disabled in the default setting . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow in very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is ski@@ pped .
this is useful when white characters are used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version will app@@ end the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not apply to the currently running program . you have to quit &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is globally controlled via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the preview command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn this off to supp@@ ress up@@ lifting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded overview column . however , sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C will appear next to the normal still a second overview column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or overl@@ apping . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you will see the differences and then decide to merge the files . a single click starts merging and uses the filen@@ ame of the last source file as the default file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used to enter this pre@@ processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff @-@ results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command line for line operations to convert the input into upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression that matches any string and in this context refers to the found text in the first pair of brackets . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ Key@@ word generated text $ . now , a pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines is needed . the \ \ prior to $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is well suited as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each symbol between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / Re@@ p / S@@ US@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , there are a few details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm will see .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the file dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the basis . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merging . to start merging , you have to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folders , you will be informed of a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that were compared to that time will be listed .
when scanning the folders is finished , shows &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can un@@ fold a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to fold all sub @-@ directories and open all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
double @-@ clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this type again .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized , select &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the necessary action is selected so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible filen@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after merging copies &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; B after A. )
when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is selected , then examined &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date appears . if such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started .
during merge , one file will be processed by the other . it displays the status column when the merge was successful , and according to other messages , if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged ) .
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or folder ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the 3 folder merge mode C will be used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge , B will be chosen as destination and when synchron@@ izing , A and / or B will be used as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries in the destination folder will be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by the specific entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut key ) . to only merge the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merge actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when merging all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Transpar@@ ent , Shi@@ ps and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merging window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear .
if you encounter an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to try out the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging .
if some entries were merged individually , notice &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge them again . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ m@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this can be folder specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a leading dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links will show . this is de@@ activated by default .
if the option is turned off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively . ( note that the link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is turned off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can , for example , be useful if the modification date has been lost when copying . this option is turned off in default .
enable synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that after the two folders are identical . also the results of merging files will be saved in both folders .
if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered as uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file was not also changed . ) This option is turned off in default . )
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension exists already , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merging view will remain visible during merging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window .
most likely you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to launch the folder .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re@@ viewing
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . please note a few things :
a path can be relative and . or .. included . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link displays a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modification date . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as differences viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts with the built @-@ in differences viewer at first . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select View from the context menu In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part .
normally needed &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select a K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; being executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure install in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly cur@@ led ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment would be conf@@ using and mis@@ used . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you will find a list of last changes in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic sub@@ folder of the &amp; k@@ war@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE gives you the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have trouble comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Pa@@ ste ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
there are only entries showing differences . this also leads to the copying of identical files when merging them into the destination folder . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default , this option is disabled . far@@ ew@@ ells in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications in it . the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ tops .
when this field is checked , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty areas are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be defined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view the windows as symbols or with their contents and move them out of the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ections of switch ... lets the dialog appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . If you don &apos;t have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is part of the k@@ de@@ base package you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting magni@@ fies &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a movable lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can show &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop down mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor settings . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ not ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it using the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this goes also with the arrow keys .
if you additionally use the &amp; Shift ; press the button or the M@@ MB ; use it , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the bottom right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button Document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Com@@ peti@@ tors &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter continues for a while at the same location . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive strain discrimination syndrome ) and that any mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor leaves for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from repeti@@ tive stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and that every mouse click causes pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the drag@@ ging with the mouse . however , this requires little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , even by simply moving the mouse you may be caused pain . if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; helps to avoid pain caused by mouse clicking , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can pull the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be c@@ logged after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Int@@ ent is switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it release the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is in between .
this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these moves will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .t@@ xt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set at a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already applied the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of the user .
the best way to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later slide the smart slide .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click stays without effect : clicking on the neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dir@@ t@@ iness with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if a move is currently underway . if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to create a ke@@ yp@@ ad . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent pushing , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very well possible to select text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : at the end of the text area , hold a mouse @-@ click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this is played every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when intelligent moves start moving time . later , you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you need to install the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , which should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter continues . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain to occur .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a drag@@ ging process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and dropping with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets the dum@@ b user speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program &amp; k@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the course of conversation that are to be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command which will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , you can choose the standard text passages . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without having to type in . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the vocabulary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the words lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you set up , you can enter the sets you want to hear in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences which are to be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ den page and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the map output voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop down box below the input field , set the string encoding , with the text passed to the voice generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as standard input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
it &apos;s possible to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service and first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first selection box action after selecting a text passage lets you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages or in the toolbar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant speaking , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . by selecting Add to the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
the second drop down of the editing window for text passages allows you to determine if the text box is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
saving changes will not save the book . if you choose to reject changes , the text passages book will not be saved . select Before promp@@ ting , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text file is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ gers dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window next to the entry field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word @-@ crossing .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop down menu .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is easily calculated by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically inserts new words into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary throughout the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as a tree structure .
the lower part allows you to edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the toolbar , or using a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt key .
the selected text is cut and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry buffer .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry buffer .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ iry buffer .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly under the menu bar above the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved elsewhere .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the toolbar above the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably did not enter the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer for more details . )
the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows us to use festival free of charge and to further distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the voice output command is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be turned on as standard input .
the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ more language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ output systems .
since the setting of the language @-@ generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ep@@ t as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting use the K@@ TT@@ SD Language Service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth &apos;s settings dialog ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak , can send text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can re@@ vo@@ ke again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice synthes@@ izer contains . a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

on the first start of kt@@ en@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no speakers furnished , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed in General . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least setup a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher will otherwise use the default speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the flash@@ card speaker in kt@@ yst@@ m@@ gr , the card reader is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker has been set up yet .
all speakers that have already been created appear in this list . the top speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give a speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a type of voting here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker on the map tab will appear . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can almost use it . go back to the card general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map tab order to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language dispens@@ ing system ; click the General tab in the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this launch is successful , the card card orders will be displayed , and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS System from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ yst@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ om@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the control bar in the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series , you can start , break , pause , and resume text orders .
the buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the clip@@ board or to open a text file for reading . you can also change the voice command for a job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General and tick language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .

filter for string replacement offers a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously st@@ ressing or er@@ ron@@ eous out@@ spoken messages . the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispens@@ ers program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to select in@@ correctly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech discourse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of Screen Reader is read , the retained jobs will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after issuing the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can read a long text on a web page , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you ta@@ int from the card orders , is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of job are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads , this issue is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
char@@ geb@@ ack@@ ers replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is delivered with pre@@ defined strings of strings , such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to &amp; XML ; converting from one format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with spokes@@ man selection filters you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not true , the text will remain unchanged for the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ No@@ tification to &amp; kt@@ ats ; is sent , it is processed by all activated filters , which have been set up on the bottom . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the filter type , and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below .
for the creation of string selection filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged against the corresponding substitute text . upper and lower case is not observed when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Re@@ place column . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or phrase in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl key .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will be provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , if &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies .
the string translation filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when matching . if all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( whit@@ esp@@ ace ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs Add or Edit as help to compose these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such modifications . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML , but x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable using the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
the speaker selection filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the speaker map or to a speaker with specific properties . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ons ; a text is transmitted to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers furnished on the speakers card .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text is filled with the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the dialog Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the language selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the language edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the named voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . furthermore , you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors on the synthes@@ izer so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing g@@ ossi@@ p is spent . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be corrected by a string generator filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice synthes@@ izer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ats ; , for information which is not yet contained in this manual .
the speech &quot; speech @-@ wi@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile &amp; extract , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bug@@ ging or downloaded the tar@@ ball generated every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your voice synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that uses the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into single phrases . the user can go back , repeat , stop or cancel typing or paragraph style .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker chooses , look in .
if you click Add Spe@@ aker on Add , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the flash@@ card speaker setup will be shown . below , you will find the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to type festival .
select the encoding for text that is handed over to festival . in case of voices that are &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this gray , the voice you select does not allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster ( with bigger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up speakers ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window will appear t@@ m@@ gr at startup . otherwise , after starting only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ om@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the straight set . the Spe@@ aker @-@ ID corresponds to the column ID on the map @-@ board speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or go backwards in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other map cards ) are taken over and kt@@ m@@ gr becomes smaller to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Audio card .
text orders are listed and administr@@ ated here . editions of Screen reports , warnings and messages are not displayed . learn more about the &amp; kt@@ ts message types .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or downloaded without support for the appropriate audio module ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if there are no output modules in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M tool .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ ml ; % equals half and 200@@ ms ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out yourself which device works with you . in case of doubt choose standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ats ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen readers has been read , the retained jobs will be res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next higher priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that reads messages . if you can read &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; still welcome someone who just walks the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played off before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ No@@ tify messages , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click No@@ ti@@ fications . the Card No@@ tification will appear .

if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is not read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete them . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that appears in the list on the top of the map of the speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a specific application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be carried out for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for selecting text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . also , trademarks for controlling pron@@ unciation of abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice that the festival uses in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the speed or pitch settings in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100 % ; the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single phrases . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with reading , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also skip or stop orders on the card board , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this directly .
here you can see the set @-@ off recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ level recognition filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add additional set @-@ limits filter , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting it . turn on the speakers Sel@@ ection and enter text to read . switch off the speakers selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function , the text orders can then be stopped or inter@@ cep@@ ted on the card card .
for these reasons , the standard cross @-@ border detection filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set del@@ im@@ ited filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional characters and insert a tab@@ l@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ s are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set del@@ im@@ iter del@@ im@@ iter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal del@@ im@@ iter del@@ im@@ iter filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the map menu , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the map card is displayed if
using the standard speaker ( the top on the map ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
use the most appropriate speaker with all the characteristics of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the original features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property has preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since language is a critical factor when understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field of speakers that are most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker and then use speaker that matches the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ yst@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get trac@@ ing .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and crashes . you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x the command is to register @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by this , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try updating or un@@ installing G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time . when I stop a text order , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; a message appears which states : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is the problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ om@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ep@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / call@@ int / call@@ int / call@@ int / call@@ int / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; where you have found the voice , send to the developer .
in order to do this , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card for speaking devices . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the speech speed settings are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) Dis@@ enable either the filter for converting from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML format filter , and set up the speaking speed .

I have added an own string generator filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer go on or go back . on the card tra@@ il@@ bla@@ ster orders will be displayed , the job consist of only one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for del@@ im@@ ited limits instead .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your voice synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the Linux &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . choose the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language dispens@@ ing system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found at .
this procedure adds additional wra@@ pper code to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the Network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux ; if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network settings module will be loaded when selecting the Network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when the module network settings starts , this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which best matches the distribution and the release status . by marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ queries , the setting can be taken permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you enter system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the Ri@@ der Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
with the option Manual can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask is specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be checked .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . turn on a disabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switching off an enabled network device will be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface ....
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that provides physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8,@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be added , removed or changed by selecting an entry and up or upgrading in the list with the kno@@ bs down or down in the priority .
clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution can be added a DNS server . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... edit the Edit dialog .
the name well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting if there are no DNS servers available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list contains some well @-@ known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add ... The Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , de button add several times and enter the additional alias name .
select an entry of an especially known calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The Di@@ alogue Aff@@ authentic@@ ated Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will update the list of the static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately visible in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a GUI can be used with a graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; edi@@ table configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focuss@@ ing on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to know which IP address of a network interface is assigned . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator who as@@ signs a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . anyway , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a range specifically reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 15 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

it appears the standard k@@ de ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the user &apos;s schedules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective extrac@@ ting . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat , which can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; console the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects and k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band is integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for by opening the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat with a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat . floppy disks usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you commit the backup process , you need to select the files you want to backup . that can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is started , the Settings dialog will open . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings dialog , the Security dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select Edit menu item .
once the check process has been started , the dialog for Veri@@ fication will appear . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for checking .
this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over from the File menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the Settings dialog will appear . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band content . this del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this creates a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command file loads load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat to lock the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the tape is ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option for floppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat to change the hardware @-@ file block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must report the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only record one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . furthermore , experienced users provide quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , experienced users can provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful functions , including :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of sy@@ slo@@ g server and sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; provides functions that allow you to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open to you , and it opens instead of that a small message window , so you have started &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user .
you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or according to entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified , so that only log lines are displayed , so that only protocol rows are displayed , if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column . for example , select the process column in the protocol @-@ file system log , and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol rows of the level indicator . the coloured display of protocol rows can be switched off in the setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
you can also check the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new add @-@ on lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You can find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for control of program start @-@ up when bo@@ oting the system in the Linux world . and this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I won &apos;t go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the Linux kernel looks first under / etc on an in@@ it file . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when you run the system or switch to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be included in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also run r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something on the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one that it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab manually and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then come and fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one contains a K , the script is called up with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or a different time device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts between levels or move the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this only happens if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the scope of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below the previous .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ways and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO @-@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available , which are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the runtime level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after making any changes , you must save them . either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card@@ boards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double click on the entry .
some map cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have activated space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users will create a map card where you can make individual settings . additional learning flash@@ cards appear if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management card is displayed if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if for at least one included fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation
the group card groups are informed about the group preferences of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works analog@@ ously .
this module allows you to install the LI@@ LO Selec@@ tor , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot of the default operating system , add , remove , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
