<seg id="1">To translate the module website you will find in the & konqueror; menu under Extras web page translate. select the output and target language of the translation from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the site of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish usually produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, you should not make important decisions dependent on the translations without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be compiled on the Babelfish page itself, where you can directly insert texts to translate.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Learn more about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror; choose settings extensions... Open the box map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the kde; addons. please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash-module, click in the & konqueror; on Extras drop-off. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Acceptance filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in the & konqueror; choose Extras DOM Tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps provide the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily recognized if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. thus, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can be either a depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for the display or if the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item. it is not always observed in the Treemap in & FSView; frames are drawn to ensure the neural entries are no longer available. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How partitioning the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is done is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always preferable to divide areas in such a way that rectangles arise which are as square as possible. the best methods concerning this are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View holding the area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget designed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery you can find in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery create... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery, a dialog opens, which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotation area to set the number of thumbnails of each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box File name of the image, you specify whether the file names are displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set with a slider or a rotation area to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the box comment file you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own Color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You will find the media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; menu on the Navigation Pane window, or with the key shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the Navigation Pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser Recognition adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser ID of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for sites that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to access with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use the own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this deprecated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digi. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. processing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, like & eg; over the camera or lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; attempts to report problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report. this opens a dialog with a broken link. if you use these shortcuts, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all the information you need is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to answer you questions to other users of & digikam; however, in this mailing list is spoken English, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to see news about released versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digicam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to report in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you have finished editing; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter a path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data backup will be saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will you additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. digitiam settings set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder. & digikam; consider each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. during the search of the folders you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; Durance recursively listens to the librarian in all its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it iste in hidden folder. this can be edited & digitized; by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Alumlist have no photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and dropping it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can in & digicam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can be digitised; it may also work with it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported blank cameras in the Help menu Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh-Decoder2 and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digi. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transmission to the computer the camera is often used as a disk device. the connection can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the GPhoto2 program to communicate with digital cameras. GPhoto2 is a free, distributing software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. Photo2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of pictures with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview pictures of digipphoto2. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digitized; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitised;, KPhotoAlbum, Shockups and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to complete a function as the changes made in & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Dragging and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree tree, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selector allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. so filtering on the filename only works if this ind symbol view is displayed. which fields are displayed can be configured in the Allocation dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digitized are sorted in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the allocation properties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album importing screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, you need to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped together under a shared name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by choosing Folder from the toolbar or sorting images After collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums after date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elders, Average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digitization; open, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; support the input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list on the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe knobs in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait for a moment while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is shown below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit via Settings digiti.Please select the albums page and adjust the preview pictures to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window, which appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important properties including all keywords of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can choose all the features that were digitised; you can choose between viewing the pictures, a slideshow or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by either selecting F4 Picture Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the editing section you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by selecting the right mouse button context menu and selecting the application from the File Type submenu. the applications listed there will be checked by the & kde; file assignments for the file type.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image editing programs, you may encounter problems with the metadata included in the picture. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. this way, this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for turning. the simplest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview button and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want a photo of & digitized; delete, it will be moved into the garbage bins of & kde; moved. F8 image deletion or Del If you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">"" "the" "" "My Datumsliders" "" "view; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last change of the file." ""</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also easily fold parts of the tree & quot; My stitch list; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned cue in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost once and digitised; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either & quot; My stitch & quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keywords. if you want to add a new keyword after you clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be used for substituting this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword may be only once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My stitch.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos that you want to tag with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate cue word in the tree & quot; My citation & quot; alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword assigning them from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords you assign to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame which displays the time unit. thus, all associated images are displayed in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Nebajut search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search finds results. if you click here, the filter will be deleted and all images will be shown again. if Search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this, you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as the search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the OK button and the search will be done. the Save search function will be used to assign a name to My search list. if you want to change your selection after search again, you will need to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit the search, the search form will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you select as advanced search, the advanced search dialog will appear to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Clear in the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digida; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database. all rules are added by line, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group or delete them from it. each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or at least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is a section in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one. using a swellar, the results can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture somewhere around the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; finds the suitable pictures. again, a swelltale can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this will of course require your pictures to contain Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any point in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lightbox add from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window will open. if you are back in & digitized; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated console with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview window you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area to see. if you select preview from the toolbar and execute the Zoo or move operations on one of the images, then they are also executed with the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of both pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate pairs from the toolbar, then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the areas to compare. the right adjacent image will be displayed in the right pane. this simplifies it through a number of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletions work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated field. this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to swivel the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; then both images will be shown in the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image inside and out. this happens in both images if you are the same in the Preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers each part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and the permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos takes a form of digital inventory management. however, most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up, find, protect and use photographs again. we focus on the procedures for digital photography the & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing, archiving, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transformed, confectioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you do not need to find a certain photo for longer without stock management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use it certainly not & digikam;. the approach to store metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc. make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant import of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to re-organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the Settings page of the metadata in & digitized; to enable EXIF and IPTC data to be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item from the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? to do so & digikam; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes available. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, captions and an assessment to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiarrives; automatically mount the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by dragging a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, you'll start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">Wow! one starts to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is it to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save any amount of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it for a selection of images simultaneously. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was she not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting geolocation are already countless and will be deep-moving in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical indications. this then displays the photos at the location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is digitized to & digitized; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not wanted to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can't be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author-line): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's work name. examples of this can be titles such as: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note on the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here, which you provide the image to others. if the image is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify them in the image. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digidazed; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, panel failure, shocks, ECC, transfer errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, withering superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it's about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, you need to be treated more cautious and you may not be trusted for more than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece which requires a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. that is why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control humming. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from corrupted disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly start burning with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also, read the media with a description, date & author badge and then store in a clean, dark dry and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives: discard study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: dispensers are the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower tempertures, the error rate is increased dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure, SMART bugs the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make up a lot of electric shocks, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. at your computer, these anomalies can cause scratched keyboards, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed Motherboards and other defects. thus protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a portion of the energy heat and gives the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that also all peripherals connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable over voltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a non-stop power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models permit them to continue working until the current runs again. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with the cost of avoiding it. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be kept for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are referenced to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies a backup and a distributed memory are included in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not if it happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undetected until one day you should open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard with a GPL compatible license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. with notebooks, the share of thefsteels is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, such as thefts or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS, to name the most popular file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more deteriorated. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anyone else for data loss. so you often get your data on a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or changing the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you, you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aviation gap: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for a loss of data is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete backup and the latest differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshot images. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each additional thinning should happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, associate XMP files, retained original memory, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert it to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printer for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollars; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # operates with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of fs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it can be much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that it needs relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (defllate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a royalty free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and obligated to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace & quot; Image resource blockquot; -Technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a blend of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo, mostly in raw format. XMP fits as it stores metadata separatly from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file and as indicated above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation supporting fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera image, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edited & digitized the images again, you should add the metadata again, which may be cut off by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them into web galleries, encode them in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; in the section Add a photo to an album you will find a description how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your database database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To digitize your digital camera; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and switch it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a Finish indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that not all information is available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">Tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as the Exif, manufacturer's notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar made of the main window of & digitised; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All. this downloads all the photos from your camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are securely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the selected download button is displayed as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. until now, these images have not been downloaded by & digicam; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums is shown, like normal folders sorted, displayed. details for folder sorting can be found in the My Albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have chosen the target album, press OK, and & digikam; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once, using the Delete Delete button. if you want to delete only some, you have to select them first and delete selected delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in & digitized; you should carefully check if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this via the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often use not very meaningful names as file names for the photos. the file names are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two will affect the data about the author in the section default auto-identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format than the standard format, for example, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-%% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. to do so, turn off the date & time option. for further modifications you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file names, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which has been digitised; used for a photo, is shown below the name the camera provides in preview. your settings to rename are saved and automatically used when you next time open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitized; can use all information about the camera orientation at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section of Metadata tab, you can read more details, about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, you can download the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section of Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, it stores & digitised; the photos directly in the destination album. if you want to change this, you must disable this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is finished, ask & digress; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position specified in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it is interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architects and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digimaster; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to store the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and finally through manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by forwarding the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in the GPX format as this is the only format supported by the geo mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExiTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the predefined coordinates that are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not display European street maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digities.You need to change the settings dialog from the Settings menu; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for authors: this field should include the photographer's profession. this can be names such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a closer description on the car field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to provide the indicated picture. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available for other programs and can be imported in & digitized; imported without loss.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image identifiers as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. thus, your captions can also be read from other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer is in the main window over a file. depending on the option chosen, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify what file types & digicam; to indicate, you can add and remove the file extensions to that list. each file in one & digicam; Albumfolder, which won't have any of these extensions, has been ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">When you open the luminaire, these settings can be set if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the light density than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression mode, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files option you can compress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF image. it does not affect image quality as the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of Lossfree JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react with more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. this option draws the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the highlights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the point lights, so the parts of your images that are burned in, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed white in the settings. use the setting colors to solve some unusual results as it shows the pointed-lights in various roses. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the pointed-lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you will be given the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the & digitized image options; to keep the time for the demo version small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosmov algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Drapie provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction as it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information how to translate color information from a color space in the other is to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & digikam; check this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not include color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma doesn't fix for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color-mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore function very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here a table of cameras and profiles will fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewers and picture editing. by deploying this interface can & digitised; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and they will then be loaded by & digicam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be found via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. other check boxes turn on the metadata that appears at the lower end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left side show a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right top there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in picture display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To digitize your digital camera; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera models and ports manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera, which is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the Mülleimer you can view & digiswitch; when deleting a photo in an album. deleting a photo and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly worked through & digitised; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries to apply. otherwise, you need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digicam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitized; they may therefore not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting up Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it. you can save it with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore from the File menu or using the Restore Restore button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be undone or restored. you can undo the last action by editing undo / restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB; press a moment longer via the Return or Restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made any changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change this in the settings dialog by & digikam; you can view this from the digikey; see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the Print dialog from the File menu and get the Standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. entire image templates can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Assist from the Select Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The Main Window has a sidebar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the Apply button, there is a button More. with this you can read other metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always performed when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC-field urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this & digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered keyword, allowing you to quickly limit the number of ways to search for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are keyword in the IPTC-box keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar with their album, - date, keyword and search view is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">The keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is pulled from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s specific implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow complies with all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image issues are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color gamut and thus have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB means you have to calibrate your monitor to sRGB, then you either have to callibriate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Auto Ability and Contrast extend from the Correcting Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity values over the entire image, so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similar: this method adjusts the intensity control factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity canal becomes as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic matching: this method maximizes color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a restylisting of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The tinplate correction is slightly limited as a colour space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can thus far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the controls mentioned above, use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values will also be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make it exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding rate per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the color correction menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and also allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"" "the" "" "digital" "" "tool has four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter." ""</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a result of the emergence of a partially developed pressure from a short flash of lightning and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediterrarium; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider reps the strength of the neon light. in case of large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photo. you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too large saturation. in this case too, the brightness / saturation tool is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than to increase it. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the instrument tone correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the application described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel, or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into and that can be shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side represents the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controls and pay attention to how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the image settings. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark notes, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammaids.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a bleached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: this button automatically sets the image values depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and later loaded. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that have been taken with a digital camera, linear mode usually creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the light notes, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">When you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line appears on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for that is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three colour pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digital channel mixer of the digicam; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color gradations of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Colours channel mixer for image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the corresponding color components. this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Monochrome. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. farbrauschen consists of small artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. preserve the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown at (1) and the modified image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstract capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all the scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and enhances the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of leaching a pressure and redevelopment in a squamate. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) scepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the digicam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tridimensional texture of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect is applied in the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed item (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digicam; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to retain his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image. passing through the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled it with a cute three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttoneffect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have previously used the tool according to aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into one image at any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Use the & digicam; apply tool stencil you can put a template across a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Menu image Template Apply in the image editing can be used to lay templates over an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your stencil to the digicam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the basic folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder has been set for templates, a tree view reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the preview pane of templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button will shrink the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template on the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the image and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has assets in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional sharpening tool. it is very fast and easy, but it produces fine grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture more sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychotropic. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process requires colours with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to sharp edges becoming a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more subsequent sharpness than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a field of focus while reading the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can invoke the sharpness with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. generally, the most suitable technique for the sharpening of an image will refocus the tool. you can reach it via the menu entry Correcting. under refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to soften the softmark with the menu entry Correcting softeners and experiment with something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unfocus masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window will show the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and impression of grats will create close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined thus for an edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft transition between the tones are excluded from the sharpening and thus finishly errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image the (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filterung. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filterung. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocusing mostly reaches better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauss's folding is actually very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focus: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value 1 should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0,1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palatal sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß 'sch is. in most cases, you should have this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a non-nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the edge-shaped sharpness or the palatal sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations will not immediately visible changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unharshly masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna Filter, it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese Filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of obtaining sharpness in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Smooth knob sets the sharpness of the area darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependent Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a movie granulation or CCD slippies, a high value will generate wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create an 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular step-step since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long run time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step size in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal, but it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make it exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and carry a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is an unusual black artefact in the foreground that was caused by a bad film deposit during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artifacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can damage the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller defects cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward in order to detect lamp changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and hissing or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise cannot be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the light density tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas typically consuming more. however, it also conceals the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter range responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it can be too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than sharpens a picture. use tool to soften the softmark with the menu entry Correctly soften and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauze's noise, movie granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized images. smoothing takes place along the image contours and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and carry a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures are reduced to an old color photograph, which has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown at (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">"" "the" "" "Hotpixel" "" "tool allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGpixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp." ""</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark-image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the Dark Picture button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitized; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignetting compot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with Center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as there would otherwise be blurring effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's film and color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction does the transformation with a center filter on an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is an optical filter with aperture adjustment of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction decreases the brightness of pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer recalibration of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image editing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the grading correction on one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth slider corrects the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, barrel-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the fourth degree of distortion. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite signature of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next startup.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correct correction should be performed first. if you want to re-cut an image and then perform a tonal correction, the effect would appear to be false.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to view the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion-shaped distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove it with the trimming tool in the menu TransCut trim from the image editing or through the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown at (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the Preview you can set two parameters of movie granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Adjoining movie granulation if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel, it makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digital filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The shot effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image acquires a timeless ambiance released from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the movie effect effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>

<seg id="601">Two knobs exist to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitized; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. the lines whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to sketch you. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original picture (1) and the modified image (2). the default values of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digital filter engraver shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digital filter is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important thing on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: splits the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurr: blurrings the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurrings the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to appear back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurrings the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurry of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blur: blurred the image softly into the dark and strongly in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sheathing sharpness: blurrings the image through a random shift of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a protected algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can play with the digicam; image editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen Filters. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning it into the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the size of the tool. choose Transformers size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the size of the tool using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with better quality, try to blow up the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create an 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarge every single shot for photo, can be saved as a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can blow up an example of photo bubbles by magnifying a small color image to twice size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear augmentation for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently executed operation but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or File Save As menu in the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of the height and the transverse-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible depending on the selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed triangles are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "the" "" "Settings" "" "settings allow you to hide help so that you can get your pictures together better. these help are:" ""</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic Triangle: harmonious pitches are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party gel, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden centre is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number is equal to the sum of their two progresses. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquefied guides if you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in contrast to the third gel, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the observer's gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to guide the golden spiral. it should be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertex points are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal angles. diagonals can be placed on these lines.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic part.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it easily happens that you don't hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digicam; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose Transformers Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformers crop cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option leaves the picture a little bit after the rotation. but keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recomputed. on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="673">Turn right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="675">Right bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">Once you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation crop cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal shear for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shear your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can narrow horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line will be displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shear tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets blurred. for a single shearing, this effect is mostly negligible, but two formulations generating double so much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the picture has some nice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation crop cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write about image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitized.</seg>

<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically Share without duplicate. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">The upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="707">'mouse over' style: displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over- and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the left lower corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The sidebar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this will of course require your pictures to contain Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallet files that are supplied by & kde can be applied either for the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are located in your Personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user defined color and lastly used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Load Palette dialog you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders according to files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is shown as a line in the Pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It displays the color next to it. the color is described in the pallet view. here, the color name can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used for selecting. to create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Cursor is enabled under the color button, the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode is overwritten. you can set this mode by selecting the overwrite panel under the cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection, which was created as described in the last section, can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the proportions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end marker, if another color follows. if so, three numbers in the clipboard can be added as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that include & graphviz; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kGraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kGraphiviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph.The & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kGraphiviewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of graph in & kate; renews the graph again and in & kGraphiviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or graph in & kGraphiviewer; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knot and one hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kGraphiviewer; is a & kde; -program, which presupposes the & graphviz; -Tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. needs are needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kGraphiviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or choose this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Using the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded & kGraphiviewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kGraphiviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can make the menu item Settings kGraphiviewer; setup... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graphene file outside of a running & kGraphiviewer; instance; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice of whether you want to open a new & kGraphiviewer; instance or to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the portions of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphene without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kGraphiviewer; when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kGraphiviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked at any start afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="750">& dot; -algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directional graphs. the algorithm determines the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unstructured graphs. it produces representations according to the jumping model model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; -algorithm creates a jumping spring model for unlighted graphs. it uses the Fruitman pure gold heuristic, and includes a latch for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm orders the nodes in a circular shape according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should specify the graphene file as parameters, and the calculated layout of the graph will yield stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change special options, or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that is supported by the Sane project or another source like e.g. Video Streams. to do this, you have to have kooka and sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures open a dialog which lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears as you can replace the default values duccrow to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After scanning the button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window for setting the options of the target image appears. please remember that type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; or create it by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected the screen shot in the Import menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to the people who are important. you can display your favorite photos of the world, place photos of your camera's phone online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have clicked Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module is launched to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current permissions that the module displays. to upload, you will need write permission. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should be pressed once you have all other options set. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as tags during the upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localisation provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. psbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localisation correlative. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS lane.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-looking dialog will appear. in order to perform a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with a GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that displays the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. lies the deviation thereunder the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures, you can manually edit the GPX file and add them to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality a localization is in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlative to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog turns the coordinates from one call to the next, you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">Select the region and enlarge it. always select the region in question and increase it again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are ways to mount the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages conforming to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 in order to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">This module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each picture creates a page, a new page opens in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album will define the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth you can change the default color depth. this of course also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production. the web browser is automatically started in the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming, or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and pastes. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client module is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the Metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. for burning the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that you can start generating the module using Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that displays an image. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set up next. in case of doubt you should let it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your preferences, you can start with the coding button to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the Settings button at the bottom right corner.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in the RAW file into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not effect any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information on your image and uses the lossy LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently or later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before worsening the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite the existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images on an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending upon image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resize in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional scale variation in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will appear with the images you have selected. you can add more images via the Add Images menu with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "with the" "" "Remove Images" "" "button the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent." ""</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't be sure to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of e-mails to send. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After adding comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best suited to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original JPEG format files, then the original source is added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button closing, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL Output option in the presentation activates very elegant picture transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filename indicates that the file name of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop. you can then cancel it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select to show the images in a random order. so it will not be used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images, the temporal distance between the pictures can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly selects a different effect from each transition between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse in this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The background image of the KIPI module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your images and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons can be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to select which image to display for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the picture-view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the image should be displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the Find dialog in the main window, you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again in the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the lettering or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like reading manuals, but rather want to try out the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; start for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data stats about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database, displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will appear in the preview window) and also the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate to the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding the mouse button down and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this period in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each section is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description which will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether to create a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. you will find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically explained.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 cannot download any pictures, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transfer time. if you want to get a picture bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder you have to manually copy them to it. for the import function, see, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have moved all three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum, you may want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have spent a lot of time for it, you will need to work with & kphotoalbum; do not do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and import.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external ones. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a shortcut to pictures. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all images together and share this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL that you specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images that you can access via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy Manually to the .kim file, you have to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & kphotoalbum with the Automatically option to the .kim file; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be up to 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu Import... select, becomes & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Importing Wizard consists of four steps. first you have to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folders the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is called to your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside several picture groups. if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see an image with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) searching and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently it also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the uppermost folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g., normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; note the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start with the -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the menu entry, Settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window that allows you to change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user manual, the different settings options will be explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings for the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog which is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog you can set up entire members groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its module system with other graphics applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page, which you can access via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules are shared by several applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with a & kphotoalbum. therefore, you should always test new modules with the Demo Database before you access them on your own pictures. you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinit.exe\ &gt; or over the Help menu. don't tell me I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that share the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules to work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums: this is an album just a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for some modules, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">In doing so, it simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, is all the pictures that shows you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, I have to add a list of albums to the modules. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category that you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, you will do & kphotoalbum; so do, so whether you would have chosen persons to view and pass on this to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, see above a menu and a toolbar. under the toolbar you will see the window that you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain much information since you have not yet entered information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the image, where the image has been taken, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by setting up people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by means of that the names used are moved up, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sort button on the date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and annotate them with annotations. in this case, simply click on the buttons before and back, which are under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window showing the USA as an overgroup. to show you that this is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you would like to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the image in your browser, you will get an overview of thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images in case you have no filter set. an example of this can be found here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the removal button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will appear which you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; you can also use images anywhere, so you can record the pictures somewhere, thus & kphotoalbum; you can view the image from & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not saved on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are present for pictures 5-9. however, for pictures 5-9 you can view the thumbnails. however, you can not view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back into. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now to ask for inserting the respective CD. so if you want to avoid trouble, such as the jumpring of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you accessible to others and click on the current view lock in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that your little sister may see, navigate and lock the menu item all except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your younger sister, simply select the menu entry to lock pictures, thus removing all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered in order to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply choose password change in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to avoid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them at some point. for this reason, it has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start it from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. he obviously shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and lay somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether you want information at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. the appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the info box are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the appropriate entries on this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image below and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing Ctrl key and Plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. the Plus button zooms in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the sole key sets the zoom so that each pixel matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they come in and out with the plus and minus button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can annotations to the current image with the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can see the abort and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the picture and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pushing the corresponding letter. in the picture you can see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">This is described in detail. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to display categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you can use & kphotoalbum; to paint on the image.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you have to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the Object Tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar, or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop down menu is displayed for you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete selected objects from the scene using deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified properties, click Apply to take over those changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or reject the Cancel changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the indicated object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross will appear in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility stage of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window rules or if you need another configuration, you can set them as you like. you can also save multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the path to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the path to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the tap into the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card-card-riders at the top of the view.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the tap on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the connection bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the connector bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view window arrangement... store. it displays a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it renders. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Renders icon The Rendering icon in the toolbar, or choose the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A rendering mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render Modi, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the menu View Render Modi... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is useful a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image edit to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lights. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling frequency refers to neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split again and again and Adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional pixels will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually tracked and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray, which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; Import scene, select the Import Menu File Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, it supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this inserts the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With Copy and Paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, opens and kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. place here the path to your document retention and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object start of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a better wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can specify the depth and threshold values in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window frames or create new window arrangements. in the section window rules, explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down drop down menu: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Add Existing Window Order displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">New column creates a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten anchors the window under the existing window, with card card you get a map card view together with the previous view and floating, the view does not anchor in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit menu entry. thus you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create. in particular, note that in the fourth wireless model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry called Camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points where you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When pressing the Apply button or the Enter key, the wiremodel views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert endly body quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a complicated method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now displays the plane, even though at the moment only as finite finite layer. if you render the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scale, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property image (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the Preview button you will see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the Pigment Preview shows only a matte black material because you have to enter Settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time by clicking on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and ball in the preview, just click the Apply button and then invoke the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree always choose monochrome and change the colors in the view of the properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler. the ball can be easily created as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the bottom. otherwise, the ball would float above the bottom as you moved the bottom around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Property and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on the pigment button, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even when metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a rendering method to produce a two-dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and refracts the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog work. thus, the scene is processed pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last svn command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option to change default short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Configuration & kuokie dialog, there are five learning flashcards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images are opened in full screen. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color, which you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, loading & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>

<seg id="1169">In order to scan an image, the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1170">To better select the image the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection. it can also set the zoom in such a way that the entire preview will fit into the window.</seg>
<seg id="1171">When the image has been selected, the final image can be read with the scan button.</seg>
<seg id="1172">When saving a preview in the settings selected, the image will be displayed in a preview window, as shown below. when saving is pressed, then the image will be saved and Schlie? en leads to a demolition and you get back to the main window.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; -Shortcuts. this makes your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, most of which are also found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options from Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok also has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all necessary modules are present and use kdialog so that the user know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Resin require' corundum 'rescue LoadError error =' Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script. '' kdialog --sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">The scripts / templates folder contains a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages make it possible to run external programs and commands. usually, the exec () function is used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. in addition strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Sets the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signals that a new piece is picked up. the script could now be used with DCOP functions for further information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizing: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle will also be passed to allow the script to use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; exit, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2) .tar.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with a command of amarokscript. for this reason, you should designate your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the Amarok Category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, rather than having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have a few playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music. these and many other useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>

<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment to display the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers enable even more settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder into the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes to specify how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok to browse both the checkers and their subfolders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allow & Amarok to monitor the selected folders upon changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: cause & Amarok; add all playlists found in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library. you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes while editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-Info, but not flagged as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = mp3:: Mplib = $mp3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error while writing the tags from $ARGV [0]\" unless $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: amarokapp: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check whether Amarok will use the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colored Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to adjust the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device needs to provide a blender. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio. this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g., sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you'd just want a white noise.

<seg id="1325">Listening to music should be very simple! for this reason, there is the setup wizard that appears at the first start of & Amarok; if you don't like your collection afterwards, or simply don't like the wizard, this Quick Start Guide will help you. with your help you will have set up & Amarok; in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1326">To create a playlist is very simple. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. tap into the text box, then the tree view will immediately display the remaining matching entries. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save them with the help of the button Save Playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection, and you have the option to import playlists enabled, you will find these playlists already in the tree view. by right-clicking on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select Actions Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the Playback button.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed which make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has a player window with the most important functions. in addition, a playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter describes how all the functions of & Amarok will be used, including the creation of a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Centre. at the top of the window there is a text display showing the current play time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area will change the display of the already expired play time for the remaining play time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch by the available Analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the pane.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer will appear in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the barrel, the PL and EQ buttons are also displayed. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece positional slider. use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume. with playback buttons, you can start playback / stop and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you check the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist itself is easy to use and yet even for advanced users.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context Browser shows various information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow will be dropped. the information presented there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; the information can also be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music displays information about the current piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. see how often and when the piece was played for the first and the last time and its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be located in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tag.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorites of this performer. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music sub-window. right-click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, album of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist that you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual sections to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text below, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. to do so, no running text script is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com for the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Group interprets - only grouped the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there will be another split after the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under Various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group interprets / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Group Genre / Interpret - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it acts in the list view as well as in the tree view. you can find hints about using this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year. of course, you can also select your entire collection, which makes the filter practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This displays the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces into play in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name to save the list.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player. see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for pieces information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files into the garbage bins... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under Various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Undo the compilation - Change a selected album back into a normal album. the album will then no longer be shown in different interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle a lot of playlists, including smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent Playlists are possible. click on Add Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist. there, you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; to be able to use your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter, sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply. this way, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. when the transfer is finished, finish & Amarok; and loosen the disk binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a entered URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can listen to music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist becomes longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping down. in that case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. as soon as you enter characters there will only appear the pieces that contain the characters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type in between the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing whitespace, then enclose the search term with goose bumps: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not after entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you may also search for bigger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that doesn't contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this looks for all the pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist. to the right you will find playlists, empty playlists, and Random Mic.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, expanded analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the Player Window using the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and setting up toolbar buttons... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The Status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status of random mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking twice in the respective display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on menu. over this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the Visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualisations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This entry hides a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to see in the cover administration. select:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queues administration received your big collection in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, of which two are already given (the details to set up the playlists later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscanner). this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the desired playlist, drag it to the playlist window, or right-click on it and then select Load. thus, your current playlist will be replaced by the new one. so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two preset modes of Random Mix and Playlist Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly. the featured playlist starts with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece itself from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added at the next batch change, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point. using the same menu entry, dynamic mode can also be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New button restores the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode. playlist Edit opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">By right-clicking on a dynamic playlist, you have the ability to click Edit. then the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will continue to grow, the setting for upcoming pieces will be skipped and you will not hear a piece of it in this playlist. however, if the setting is active, the pieces already played will be removed while respecting playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist, so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will grow continuously, because only one play can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section. on the left of the dialog you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you cross multiple playlists, you will add & Amarok; random pieces from each of the playlists you want to play.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts enable your own settings. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok; scripts by clicking on the script. a selection dialog will open in which you can choose a script package for installation. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear in the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1466">This function only causes an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image of a CD that you can then burn sometime later. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copying. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also only create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn sometime later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copying dialog. the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog will not yet have to be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW, which allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), eliminating the content completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for an * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for an * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously used DVD video can be converted, and this dialog box will help you. this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the read-out video, encoding settings, and even possibilities to change the size and trim black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar at the bottom of the window will appear. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will appear in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info, locking and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, provided a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header bar is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can customize the keyboard assignment below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrators need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work straight away. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can use either the dcop command line program, or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and style of your task is crucial, which of the contributors you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to general & DCOP; features that all have in common, support & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () void copyCd () void SQDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString) void addressl (QString path) void Rename Item (QString path) void RenameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void-VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dco</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; read for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data in wav files on hard disk) and by many coding that encoded those wav files (these Kodiver packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). more Kodiers can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on your computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) compress into the mp3 or OGG format or even in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if it is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders have to be installed. all these programs are generally available for any Linux distributions. however, only the Kodiver packages need to be installed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read off the audio data from the CD; this program is not intended to bypass some copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device bypass the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid buying a copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), later the daily approach to reading a & CD will be explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface through which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Convert to many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must be established first.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - when an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup file - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default. it is to be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main Setup dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different learning flashcards (such as Encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information with data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences become less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG, lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo devices. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see the 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should generally provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has a very high quality. good enough for hi-fi audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi audio systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a track. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate app. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car osterolers. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overstated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size, select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information retrieved manually or fetched by the program automatically from freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter from & kaudiocreator; the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiogenerator; parameters that can be needed (= button in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / input the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information which is publicly available on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiogenerator; is active to select an address (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address as the one in the system. in this way of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrored servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save songs from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first, if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read-out wav files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), ognc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are on the tab for setting up the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the codec can be used. this is also required for the predefined codec. more information about Kodiver is found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a encoder, you can receive further information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, ognc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check, if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; please check the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 video keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example using a search engine, as it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory is / usr / share / cd and that you have write permissions (eg; by trying to copy something inside with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably only done once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a CD; what needs to be repeated for each CD you want to read.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any time you read a & CD; change once the right settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program, so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device identifier of your disk. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything will be left and entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information ask for information so that you will be informed if information for creating keyword (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download over the Internet from a freedb host.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during read-out of the & CD so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries from it. the directory or file name is changed with the order name &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Taggers.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set it as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server in your area. on this path the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send & CD; data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously discharging pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so just try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something needs to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi audio systems. the resulting bitrate is average 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1.ID3v2 'Tags may also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tag for & kde; in case of a later modification of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoding WAV files: with a dual core or square or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to encode more than a wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet will be built up, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & write.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots show a little different from the data fetched for a CD; with success of freedb logged data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this is only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, check the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; Successfully fetched from the freedb, all titles of the pieces have already been filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment range. if you use ID3v2 tag, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiogenerator; take a look at the 'basic settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor anytime. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">In this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "", "go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line activates the selection of the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at a time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the Selection button to read out the read-out process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error when trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been encoded successfully are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. do you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with performance-saving machines, the result is unclear. the used calculator with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people compiled from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be customized to suit your needs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variations in settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the various learning flashcards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; it is intended to do something useful or change it. at least after making contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde;. besides others, he also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real time upliftment of lyrics, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. ALSA will be included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Support. if you finish & kde; during playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window to the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the play button in the toolbar, select the Play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start when you draw it to the & kmid; (for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">When & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and running it back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the left and right of the TempoSheet and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically detected, which a song uses, so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">In case you want to set a type of event, select the menu preferences or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played by the row. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu item under the item Organize.... Click there on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs that you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection is not saved. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the Add button. it will again appear the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then add the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the submenu pick-up of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next Song button, next song entry from the menu item, or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the previous item, previous item from the menu item, or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map implements General MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type change patch to Bright piano in events of the type change patch to Trumpet and therefore always lets a trumpet sound when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary transformations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except for the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Defin PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define keymap "An additional keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You will see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This topic describes how General MIDI's patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to place all notes that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant where every sound is a different percussionate instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboard boards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. usage is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. see for example the included keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N channel. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined with the name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch benchmarking with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM forgives that a keyboard, which receives a pitch benchmarking event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, some key boards are trying to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & so on; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Do not forget to activate automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or go (if I want to play a karaoke file). in this way, when the collection is finished or I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file fast, without adding them to a collection, turn off the Automatically Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. but first you just want to play the first file. so set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.M. your temporary collection then contains exactly that one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; MÃ ¡laga (Spain). at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time. as a hobby I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really have a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list with friends of & kmid; if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file already.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that only appears when information is to be returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to store the preferred links under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are being played after each other, you should use the category Continuous Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy of hierarchies. if you select an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & SMB; not running. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose playlists from the same menu and either select Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left, or a different group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / ver.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be disturbing at the end of the animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; smiley; & lt; img dur = "Ing; src =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lgt; / lt; / lt; / lgt; / lgt; / lgt; / lgt; / lgt; / lgt; / etc.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting up the backend via mimetype. here's an example like a 'flash' played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & SMB; it can even include the special video embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash must be specified in the Directordialog File Orders of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a given backend for a particular type of mime (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by modifying the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before watching TV the device and TV channels need to be configured. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog will be used in Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be detected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be operational. for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMB uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitresource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdrresource.</seg>

<seg id="1744">The & Kile; -Project contains some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for various distributions. these allow for easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users don't have to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if support for this project or its documentation is desired, contact via the box; -website should be made.</seg>

<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; Desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all the & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within that a simple, direct and customized access to all & latex programs. finally, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; reference and powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kates; and to know its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of & kate; Start.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, also a Laie (inlay) & latex can be used; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of & latex is given; it is not the ultimate book. to be able to master correctly, good books such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ documentaryclass, which begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be re-closed using the\\ end {document} command.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Assist of & Kile; is a useful function for the rapid creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for the creation of the document. some adjustments may also be made to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this lists the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], Article (DIN) [scrreprt], report (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [scrreprt], film [prosper] or custom defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: the encoding of the encoding is set. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8x should be heeded (for the correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex. for integration they must only be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document categories of Koma-Script (in order to comply with the German DIN regulations). you should always find use when creating German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. this is a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - just like other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). through & Kile; if you see green areas of a green text on the screen, it's with great likelihood that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, you will be spared by the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will save time and anger through the highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the associated line to read the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in the menu folder... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files, the search search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file [more] independent file (d V ice I nection file)] was created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the common output eart of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the method search, the elements of the DVI; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file was clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text is clicked. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text was clicked, the corresponding point becomes available in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be configured to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick engineering: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file will be on the front side, and there is no call to & eyepiece; after fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be stripped. the selection panels have been developed for fast integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Another feature is for inserting articles such as tags, notes or references. the possibilities available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choose a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for the editing of & bibtex; -files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ røe is used for determining the font size. you can specify the font sizes for the main text, the notes nodes, etc. there are the following font sizes available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ documentaryclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if font sizes are not specified at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the button quick engineering.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically execute the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using rapid construction, it should be automatically started. if this is not the case, logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then add the alteration of the font size within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are taken only within the environment (from\\ begin to environment} until\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold pressure, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quote in the document. quote begins with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, mind. a quote, a few places in the fat and italics pressure and a poem to the application should be used to see the differences in these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps are necessary for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed (if the printer is set correctly) by printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code has been created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preferred search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this just have to set up Modern under Settings Kile... tools build-out.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To carry out the preface search, the mouse pointer has to be positioned in a row of the source code and then clicked on preface search. the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the appropriate & latex; -document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Okular; Set up as text editor (Set up eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using the Quick construction of the & DVI; if an error occurred, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file contains the source code in the source code. in the editor you can then click the Precious LaTeX errors and the LaTeX errors for sprint between the errors. in order to view the correct line, the error must be clicked on the error in logging and & Kile; jump to the correct line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document. more information on this can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Multilevel users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... Settings General set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ documentware [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated insertion of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then paste your own template instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex; files can be created. if an easy way to create a template is desired, one should search for one on the Internet and be carried out under the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kates; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kates; can be made directly from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate and its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile can start working directly with the Editor of & kate directly with reading the chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; meaning that this way, when you click\\ par,\\ par\\\\\\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source texts. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can include additional jump marks. this is an own type of bookmarks inside the text. the menu items or the respective keystrokes allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already offering excellent possibilities, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is added; special commands for their selection. under Edit select the following commands for text selection include:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extension refers not to a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word executes under the current cursor position. this selection also has an expanded meaning, as this command also appears as latex; -commands with an extra layer (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kates; offers the key root Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. by editing, the following commands are included in the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands under the editing environment for a very simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the start of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview over can be lost quickly. this command closes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by parentheses {...}. under the TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor above or behind the curly clamps of a & tex; -group # is jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested curly curly curly braces, the overview can quickly be lost. this command deletes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple calls are used as GÃ ¤seye. for the practical implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple calls is used. also for the end of the application the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and has two closing coupling signs for & latex.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There may also be language specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french), so that German or French suits can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">Pressing Shift; Enter an Enter key; an intelligent line break. if the current position is in a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">In a table environment, GET & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with an adjoining line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings box; set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all Et characters (amp;) to each other. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; after the next tablator in the underlying line. although this tab is not the corresponding one, add & kill; some space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kates; already offers a good source code completion, it has been added to & Kile; to add special commands (mostly for & latex;). three different modes are built for automatic completion. all of these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Kile... fully supported.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment will begin with the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, unfortunately, the complete list is hidden. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively von & Kile can also be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions can be enabled by editing hock marks, and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; full-time settings can be made to these lists. it can be selected various WÃ ¶ rteristics for & tex; - and & latex; -statements as well as owners of the general language-use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there will always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the executable mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the surroundings are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for complete destruction of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the Completate mode over the menu modified environment or the key of the Alt + Shift key, the command will be automatically inserted and it will appear\\ begin {. after that, the ambient performance can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this has been done, the environment will be closed automatically once again. as soon as it detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; full-time settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterList of the full-time mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; submit user-defined lists of cutouts, which can be replaced immediately by lower strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile can be set up fully. as an example of an assignment list, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode has been inserted, or the shortcut Ctrl + Alt spacebar is introduced, the character L is replaced by the string L\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Big â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â â â â â €â s â s â s â â s â â s â â s â â s â â €â s â s â s â s â â</seg>

<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nlichen Home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be followed and taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then be converted to a PDF file using ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To enable the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped together in the menus, compiling, converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used to Alt; 2. then, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and treated using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all the plug-ins contained and add new. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a storage location, and quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often several people work on one project in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus. supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identities) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of one's own identity are important in terms of messages and notes. see for more information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the team members: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project, so that later on, how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that launches a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event Configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Notes to enter is simple. either the note entry is selected from the editor's context menu or the @ annotation keywords are entered in a comment field followed by a comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the introduced nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team Leader Subproject Leader according to field and sub-project leaders should be given the appropriate area or sub-project names as shown in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using settings Quanta. this dialog covers some pages that are treated one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including auto-completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Uppercase / lowercase of attributes: big / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically close: if checked, will be added for tags for which the closing tag is optional, immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Starting and ending tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimeypes for detecting different types of files. using the Control Panel, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard drawing encoding: encoding of newly created or otherwise open files (where encoding the file can be skipped). however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies, so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a flashcard), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings to the standard back at the next startup is useful when the user interface is confused by changing MDI modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>

<seg id="1963">The location to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be used to specify the ad of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronizing behavior of the VPL- and the source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the representation of parser nodes in the document can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure Tree Configuration, the visibility of nodes in the tree can be set automatically when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifWC abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are part-applications of third party, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is given to the plugin during startup, so it can open the current file, the respective folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only read-read parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is checked, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then save the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely new developed. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept has been implemented which allows different implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">At present, only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugins in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -UI:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. normally appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed, with line numbers and conditions. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. normally appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a debugger, so that in the normal case, no attention must be paid to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session Start the session. close the connection to the debugger or terminate the running according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and sending information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger implements the next instruction in the script, where it is possible to cleanse functions and include into error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if it were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are in & quantaplus; used to provide support for Markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder contains two file types, the tag folder and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag files are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type over itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common-attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to each other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains additional tags that describe how to display this attribute & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus is used to obtain source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that group the elements of a list. it may occur only once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of items that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; Declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is up in the & quantaplus; -windows to start and check TagXML. a more dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when the TagXML files are loaded into & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 tagXML file. this file describes the schema &gt; schema from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. this can be edited by editing a & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries are created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus, version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD Specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... clicking on New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User-defined button, a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but on this it is not limited), which modify the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus, only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for controlling & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script can receive input from & quantaplus. in the selection box input can be determined what to send to the standard input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the default output. it can be specified what to do with the text written to the default output by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to specify actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you plan how to use it, enable dialog "Edit Day" if available, so that an entry when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Print more programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit size from another.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually as los, stared, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this icon will insert a & lt; startd; tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions specify... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus, functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set the dialog over Settings tool bar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to preview the Konqueror preview. I'll select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After realeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (will be) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus, repository, if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations, e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html tag 1 = Sunday 1.html tag 3 = tag2html tag 3 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the PHP; documentation something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the Table of Contents is referenced directly to a file (and, consequently, at the top of the tree view & mdash; the folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the docrc file that serves to design the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the ContextList (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as which documentation was used to use by the & quantaplus, community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the waste resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. there is an email-sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) send by email, send the toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus, users can download them. the contributions are checked and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a contribution to this, we recommend to sign the resources for which it uses a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">In the Upload dialog you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New Resource dialog you will have to enter the input fields (URL Preview can remain empty) and by clicking OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD DTD Package (DTEP), toolbar, toolbar, and start-up menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtp folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that appears in the! Doctype tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter attempts to bring these concepts closer to them without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus, available. from toolbars of actions everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that it can only be used by the user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a certain project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please hit in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all the tabs, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with respect to the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and corresponding user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this straight added tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and strip them. in the representation with learning flashers stand for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree view.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu shown.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire website, etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the quantaplus, workspace. global templates are always available, local templates are only available for the appropriate user and template in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands will appear with respect to the navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree sizes. it can easily change attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented entry system allows the modification of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, from the quantaplus, 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus. two flashcards at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts which are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus. is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus, then autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in PATH in front of her bin folder. same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus, then be the appropriate & IDE; for that.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus. as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developing what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; rumor is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus, enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers relied the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; write, so they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -Write, which is the correct way to insert special characters and whitespace in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script output error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and turning of the problem reporter at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the column-column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with one click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries preceding or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the .webprj file extension.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that enables, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods will depend on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manages the project. in the section & quantaplus, you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in Project Dir / Toolbars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to specify actions by setting actions... Toolbars will be saved by toolbar factory toolbars or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the hard drive. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus) team, so that the toolbar will be available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the upload of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; that you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus. own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this globally and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">This activates or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus. inserting by means of toolbar will refuse, if that day contradicts the rules at this location.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above menu items. click on them. click an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line ending identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affects any application that the KHTML-Part can use, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the & kate documentation, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or which ones can be added and the sequences can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus, is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus, project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exam.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. on server side scripts (e.g. & PHP; Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be haunted if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, don't get the hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a detailed selection of goodies.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by Angle or, by removing the tick, clips off the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties menu in the sub-window profiles or with the Shift key; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcards possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project. in order to read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles sub-window, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by showing its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the Event Configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete events. event actions are executed when a previously certain event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, opens and quantaplus, the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the File menu or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus, closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu which can be found with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select various profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile left, the button is hidden to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk will not be questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear of fear, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply swaying the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this not only helps to increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars are in & quantaplus; best cleaved over the toolbar. use and add differ. adding tooling bars is treated at the bottom of the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, and other actions such as toolbar will be removed, which can be specified in the dialog where you can specify what actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries are removed and action processed which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Setting toolbars... and setting actions can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically the document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus, provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, special documents are written in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment about a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in template-tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save As a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save option as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged and dropped to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as drag and drop or paste over the Konqueror filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files, create a name for the template and back up. by default it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal oriented approach. you can pre-paste header lines and footers or dynamically connect to & PHP; design, insert files, or link them with them. additionally, you can keep a lot of things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the Subwindow Templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the template folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded once elteral attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template view. if a regular folder would be set up, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This might be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project, and by copying content templates to a folder with special headers / footers a whole presentation can already be equipped with the right headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source editor into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -site and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor on a document that contains & PHP, a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; -Editor and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and the VPL; -Editor is active, this mode is already active, offset the active cursor from a window to the other, with the position in the document being retained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; view you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast calculators and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Let's assume that you want to change the title of the web page, so you can choose the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this can be used to reduce the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing of CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to integrate an external CSS style template by pressing the Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor can be used as in a word processor, by moving the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting using the back button or the distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way over the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it is to be noted that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other anchoring tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the table assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will later be in & VPL; work, in this release the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of style sheets. unlike other styles of style, the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be traced.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kwar3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kwar3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function changed & kwar3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people operate independently from one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result to be expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & kwar3; when merging the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check cod, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both of them differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are located in different folders then you can make the typing work easier by completely writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows for manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. open dialog records your selection and displays them next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kwar3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If a merge is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kwar3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in Open dialog you don't have to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kwar3; load them and then compare them. now you can copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot extract anything from & kwar3; only dropping text into a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one can see the color of which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">On the left of the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines. if the line change is activated, the line is shown with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) also has an info line with the output output:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually, it already contains text by automatic merging already, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict of manually resolved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in case you change your mind and perhaps select another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the results window. carefully proceed with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources choose to ignore the options or ignore ignores C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate up mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, side, side, end, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you are also used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other buttons to edit in the output window. with the Insert button, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-top), the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Forward / Ctrl-Image Able) or the next / previous conflict. therefore, differences between solved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you have to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if enabled, copy whatever you select, automatically copy to the clipboard and copy the manual copy. however, be careful with this option as you may accidentally overwrite the clipboard content.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newsprint character\, and Win32-based systems use auto-return line + newsprint\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, so you should not use & kwar3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when shutdown and restored at the next startup. (menu Setting - &gt; Kdisable 3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the selected font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered asteried. on these systems, the preset button automatically puts an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the previous line indentation will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be copied to the clipboard automatically. the manual copy to the clipboard will then be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kwar3; first, find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, while others save only a newline slot '\'. usually, if this option is enabled, this option may be visible in the page-to-page comparison, but if this option is enabled, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in the default setting. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow in very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is skipped.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are used as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, use the Select A / B / C functions for all unsolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, the original version will append the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not apply to the currently running program. you have to quit & kwar3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kwar3; not available because the language there is globally controlled via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preview command can only handle 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress uplifting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignores C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overview column. however, sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection from A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; & gt; C will appear next to the normal still a second overview column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window next to each other or overlapping. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you will see the differences and then decide to merge the files. a single click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as the default file name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kwar3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used to enter this preprocessor command. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff-results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program that themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line for line operations to convert the input into uppercase: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'The. * is an ergulary expression that matches any string and in this context refers to the found text in the first pair of brackets. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $Keyword generated text $. now, a preprocessing command for newlines is needed. the\\ prior to $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is well suited as an example for another preprocessing command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each symbol between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different as perl. perl -p -e's / RegExp / Rep / SUSTER 'However, there are a few details differently. where used\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. further operations only change the data that the newline algorithm will see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively with & kwar3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the file dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the basis. if no destination folder is specified, use & kwar3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you have to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, you will be informed of a small message window on current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that were compared to that time will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is finished, shows & kwar3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can unfold a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object, or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to fold all sub-directories and open all sub-directories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. for folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified, and if the option directories are synchronized, select & kwar3; the necessary action is selected so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after merging copies & kwar3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe) is selected, then examined & kwar3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears. if such errors are not eliminated, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merge, one file will be processed by the other. it displays the status column when the merge was successful, and according to other messages, if something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged).</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or folder), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the 3 folder merge mode C will be used as the target, in the two-folder merge, B will be chosen as destination and when synchronizing, A and / or B will be used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries in the destination folder will be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by the specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select directory merge / continue in the menu or press F7 (the shortcut key). to only merge the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merge actions by conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When merging all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Transparent, Ships and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kwar3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), a merging window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again start / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to try out the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were merged individually, notice & kwar3; these entries (in the current session) do not merge them again. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kwar3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called Directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this can be folder specific with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems a leading dot marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links will show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively. (note that the link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kwar3; crashes.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns. (the number of solved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can, for example, be useful if the modification date has been lost when copying. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that after the two folders are identical. also the results of merging files will be saved in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered as unsafe because it is assumed that the other file was not also changed.) This option is turned off in default.)</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension exists already, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view will remain visible during merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Most likely you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to launch the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory again: directory menu: reviewing</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. please note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link displays a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as differences viewer in KDEVELOR. KDEVELOP starts with the built-in differences viewer at first. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select View from the context menu In KDiff3Part.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needed & kwar3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kwar3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kwar3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select a KDiff3Part from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; being executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure install in / usr / local, but then KDE does not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly curled; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more upliftment would be confusing and misused. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kwar3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You will find a list of last changes in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic subfolder of the & kwar3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE gives you the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have trouble compiling. if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Paste) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries showing differences. this also leads to the copying of identical files when merging them into the destination folder. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. farewells in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications in it. the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and exit. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes application window to full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; view the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty areas are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be defined: classically lets & kpager; in a 2xN-grid, as is known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view the windows as symbols or with their contents and move them out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selections of switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. If you don't have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for various users: these include artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag shows the magnified area of the screen. below, this window is called magnifying window. the image that appears in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting magnifies & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a movable loupe. alternatively, you can show & Kmag; this causes a selected screen area in the magnifying window (drop down mode) or the environment of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor settings. please note that the mouse pointer is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default knot; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it using the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this goes also with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally use the & Shift; press the button or the MMB; use it, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the drop-down window is fixed and only the bottom right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; possesses a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it into the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will appear. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to store files, open a new window, print, reload (with the button Document again load in & konqueror;), Enlarge and Competitors & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen loupe. you can use & kmagnifier; you can use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor leaves for a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from repetitive strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and that every mouse click causes pain. besides, it can emulate the dragging with the mouse. however, this requires little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can circumvent the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, even by simply moving the mouse you may be caused pain. if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; helps to avoid pain caused by mouse clicking, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, make & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can pull the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be clogged after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intent is switched on, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the mousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before it release the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse is in between.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function activates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these moves will be started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set at a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; at every start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already applied the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best way to use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later slide the smart slide.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click stays without effect: clicking on the neutral constituents of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually quite simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and the dirtiness with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if a move is currently underway. if you use the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to create a keypad. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent pushing, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can deal with it. it is very well possible to select text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using mousetool; use it as follows: at the end of the text area, hold a mouse-click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this is played every time & kmousetool; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when intelligent moves start moving time. later, you can use the smart move without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; you need to install the XTest extension for & X Window, which should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer continues. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and which causes pain to occur.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a dragging process starts before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2618">Supports a & kde; -program KNotify, a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program. the settings for Notify differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Filter for string replacement offers a good possibility in & ktts; erroneously stressing or erroneous outspoken messages. the kmail.xml file, which is included in the delivery of & ktts, is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by KMail, and also the term / local / inbox, as it can be assumed as presupposed in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispensers program. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to select incorrectly spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program" "" "speech discourse" "" "works with a text. & ktats; distinguishes four types of texts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of Screen Reader is read, the retained jobs will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; you can read a long text on a web page, you can welcome to & kmouth; notifications are also messages. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order, which you taint from the card orders, is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of job are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one reads, this issue is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Chargebackers replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. it is delivered with predefined strings of strings, such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to & XML; converting from one format to another format. included are some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With spokesman selection filters you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program, which sent the text to & ktts; send to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the flashcard speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules are not true, the text will remain unchanged for the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notification to & ktats; is sent, it is processed by all activated filters, which have been set up on the bottom. the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the filter type, and the following setup dialogs are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the creation of string selection filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged against the corresponding substitute text. upper and lower case is not observed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it just has to be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Replace column. the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or phrase in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl key.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will be provided with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example, if & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string translation filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter when matching. if all input fields empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited on both sides by delimiters (whitespace).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have the & kde; & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs Add or Edit as help to compose these expressions. the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; transducers translate & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such modifications. it can only be applied to well-formed XML, but xsltproc must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is reachable using the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The speaker selection filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the speaker map or to a speaker with specific properties. you can, for example, specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktons; a text is transmitted to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program provides, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the properties of the speakers furnished on the speakers card.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is on your system the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text is filled with the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the dialog Selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The language selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the default voice that the festival uses in the output of SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filter (SDB filter). SBDs subdivide text into single phrases. this allows & ktts; faster with reading, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also skip or stop orders on the card board, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set-off recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set-level recognition filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add additional set-limits filter, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting it. turn on the speakers Selection and enter text to read. switch off the speakers selection, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktats; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the voice synthesizer does not support this function, the text orders can then be stopped or intercepted on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the standard cross-border detection filter is automatically set up when you start tmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set delimited filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional characters and insert a tablator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set delimiter delimiter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal delimiter delimiter filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map menu, you can overwrite the speaker settings for the application. the map card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Using the standard speaker (the top on the map). in other words: no speaking abilities are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most appropriate speaker with all the characteristics of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings, select & ktts; select this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property has precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since language is a critical factor when understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field of speakers that are most likely to delete the following, click on the standard speaker and then use speaker that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktystmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I do not get tracing.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and crashes. you probably have to register GStreamer. at GStreamer 0.8.x the command is to register-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved by this, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try updating or uninstalling GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time. when I stop a text order, it freezes & ktts; one. on the & Console; a message appears which states: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA-project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but ktommgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktepd / festivalint / callint / callint / callint / callint / vocals. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the URL; where you have found the voice, send to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order to do this, the program must be installed sox and can be found via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card for speaking devices. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The speech speed settings are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Disenable either the filter for converting from & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML format filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktats; read the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so the festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags for converting SSML to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you must compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a kyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the Linux & Linux distributions. choose the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; -Synthesizer. then Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; this generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed; the Network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & Linux; if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network settings module will be loaded when selecting the Network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when the module network settings starts, this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select which best matches the distribution and the release status. by marking the setting non-re-queries, the setting can be taken permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in the system management mode, you enter system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Rider Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manual can be done without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field netmask the subnet mask is specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface at boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off on demand. turn on a disabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off on demand. switching off an enabled network device will be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that provides physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678,90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be added, removed or changed by selecting an entry and up or upgrading in the list with the knobs down or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution can be added a DNS server. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... edit the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name well-known calculator describes the hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily by booting if there are no DNS servers available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains some well-known hosts some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known calculator and click Add... The Add New Alias dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known calculator and click the Add button. if the known calculator has several alias names, de button add several times and enter the additional alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of an especially known calculator from the list and select Edit.... The Dialogue Affauthenticated Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking on OK will update the list of the static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately visible in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a GUI can be used with a graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; editable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore currently focussing on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to know which IP address of a network interface is assigned. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator who assigns a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. anyway, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a range specifically reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.015; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own calculator). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files, which are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is another content found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective extracting. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; console the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects and kdat; the preload on the tape do not, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the preload, searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the index index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band is integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for by opening the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat with a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive requires formatting before use, this must happen before you can format the tape from & kdat. floppy disks usually require a formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacity, the tape continues. all data on the tape is lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you commit the backup process, you need to select the files you want to backup. that can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the Settings dialog will open. in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings dialog, the Security dialog will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select Edit menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the check process has been started, the dialog for Verification will appear. in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">This dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recover from the File menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the Settings dialog will appear. in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">This dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band index file using the band content. this deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up, such as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-winding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command file loads load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tries & kdat to lock the ejection during the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing the integration of & kdat, the tape is ejected automatically. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat to change the hardware-file block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must report the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only record one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. furthermore, experienced users provide quick access, for example, on information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, experienced users can provide quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has a number of useful functions, including:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of syslog server and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; provides functions that allow you to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystemlog; first of all, the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open to you, and it opens instead of that a small message window, so you have started & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files usually do not have permission to read under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or according to entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified, so that only log lines are displayed, so that only protocol rows are displayed, if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column. for example, select the process column in the protocol-file system log, and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol rows of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol rows of the level indicator. the coloured display of protocol rows can be switched off in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">You can also check the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new add-on lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You can find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in the & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for control of program start-up when booting the system in the Linux world. and this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the Linux kernel looks first under / etc on an init file. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when you run the system or switch to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be included in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also run rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something on the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then come and fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one contains a K, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or a different time device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts between levels or move the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this only happens if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the scope of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered from & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runways and now the machine is constantly restarted. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available, which are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runtime level so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Customization of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making any changes, you must save them. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have activated space restrictions (quota) for users will create a map card where you can make individual settings. additional learning flashcards appear if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card is displayed if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one included filesystem space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The group card groups are informed about the group preferences of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">This module allows you to install the LILO Selector, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot of the default operating system, add, remove, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
