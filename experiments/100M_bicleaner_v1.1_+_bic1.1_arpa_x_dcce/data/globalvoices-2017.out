although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceedingly great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , had read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a deep @-@ reaching effect on me , that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interests .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method One , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only ampli@@ fied my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever achieved by the Party nom@@ in@@ ally .
I was dumb@@ founded .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , who takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung agreed not with the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bhag@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she is still adapting to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Gold@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice gave me a lot of help in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp faced his way to the nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the pres@@ idency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to label the Tru@@ mp voters as Ras@@ si@@ sts .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to elev@@ ate a man looking with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note . ) : as much as &quot; white against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; p@@ un from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means much like sk@@ id@@ ding trauma ) , as the Great Van Jones said has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality - it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country has chosen as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ist whose story , as he says himself , would be nowhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for whom his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tru@@ mp@@ s land , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot destroy their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in O@@ ax@@ aca Province recorded with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the garbage
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest to Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero &apos;s church in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs .
but this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for young people .
young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village which is practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , made up of local solid waste materials , is made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before seeking the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal prosec@@ utor of this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to d@@ rank one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior manager of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia , due to pil@@ lage of the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
besides Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , who at that time had expelled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legally Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that one has noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such susp@@ icious routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly even if they have a criminal offen@@ se .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay fin@@ es , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa while supporting F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing companies , where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world , including those illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions such as coast@@ ing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , ph@@ anta@@ sies , fish protected species and fish in conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You must@@ n &apos;t run my harbor &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found fle@@ eting ships .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fish@@ ers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be located by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Prot@@ ective Organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally by means of the position of every single trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships which had previously been fishing without licence and hardly had any consequences , know now that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in the F@@ ISH trade show a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With security the aim is to let more such initiatives and structures develop in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first grand triumph : in October it set Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used tow nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ co 1 set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world ocean .

street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the res@@ ignation , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the order of Venezuela ) both images of these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them .
the debate is also being held in other parts of the country , among others in the Bar@@ inas locality , in the regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centre @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates , which makes itself felt in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; ultimately , the position of re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the opposition rally Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Party ) in which the opposition parties and political groups were joined together , the demonstr@@ ators were calling for a mass rally to support the National Assembly , which was planned for the election of 2015 , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , on November 3 .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3rd November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

on Twitter pictures of conflicts tell stories , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear a skir@@ t because otherwise you could see something that many national guards do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic opens the round , which forms the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official conc@@ ession - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado proclaim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your res@@ ignation !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which from their point of view has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ fers to refrain from critic@@ ising critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Cordoba city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was investigated for crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I believed that was ok .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t realize that you are being manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ist . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and urged me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP @-@ friends .
pass only that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and then I have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told me that I would become a secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoner .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I went in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a bed and a metal spring .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
they seldom grab@@ bed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , shoot him with water and ch@@ ased him with a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for someone to harm another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - to the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were blin@@ d@@ folded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people squ@@ at quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were called offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial Site , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military badges that are taken off an enemy you have fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a spo@@ ils of war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad was able to do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who are driving cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded against rage , struck me and cried out :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photograph of that time on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense was accused of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in prison .
I guess it has just been decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did not these people also have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that can be done to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ inst@@ ated , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even myself at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of seeing my father emerged during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
he repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly ab@@ duc@@ ted and asked myself what all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they supposedly defended were really good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I re @-@ installed the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including heavy , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Court suspended sentences of imprisonment in 28 cases and sentences between 2 and 14 years imprisonment . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ ir : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he directed the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a Death Factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organizations working on justice for the victims for many years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , established in 1995 , who represented the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the investigation took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial that is now being conducted by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shield with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driving license .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a very particularly un@@ fortunate translation in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; probably - maybe also with malicious h@@ ind thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong interpretation was to be read from the 1st to the 20th of September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ appearing daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it result in such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the f@@ ecture of Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people were offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of elderly mot@@ ori@@ sts , which are implic@@ ated in accidents across the country , is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , in Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the named re@@ porter in the latest version of the article published comments on the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to lift up against older drivers :
the article on the translation error Yahoo received the following comments , among others :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre f@@ laws in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
in this way , a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , who could translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers , who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations into the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is assessed as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that originate through machine translations show that this technique can not replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for a number of languages .
some of the wei@@ r@@ dest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online broad@@ ca@@ ster .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups that resist the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ alled and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activate your VPN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at it as &quot; calling for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ suff@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates its meetings .
previous research by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains .
if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ v@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later , he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and raises testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mean tas which have been the victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Global Vo@@ ices published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices of America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she , from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to afford countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is in@@ oc@@ ulated by the Cri@@ mean is generally still silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with her and justi@@ fies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will know about it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent impacts . she died shortly afterwards .
she was 14 years old .
she was cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military belonging to Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra went on with a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered le@@ thal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice rooted deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widely spread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the couple &apos;s neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a spe@@ edy study of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - if Paraguay &apos;s case is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before the court for the first time in the history of Paraguay .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to sign up bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
her brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ mean .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time for learning .
she rose at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Friday , for example , she clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the library of the house than eating out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family often because they felt I would &quot; learn bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; they meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ ani , would once again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .

because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .

society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to us .
starting from Monday if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ eventh @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad joined the advertisement again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you , I am writing again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mean tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mean tas , writes :
in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani ) and their &quot; wives &quot; have been subjected to them . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill introduces Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , edited by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently approved a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation on the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site with their real names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a sentence of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine .
the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ es in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not give notice to how Egyptian authorities should account for the registration . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users were given a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , blocked by Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology .
in my opinion they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could be done online as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a law@@ suit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by no means realistic in any way - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensures that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , MP T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment for those accused of threatening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the article is published here as part of an agreement on content sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ y Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards , which stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a great pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region are set up .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the conservative daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; thre@@ ef@@ old disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami resulting from it .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had made whole coastal towns disappear from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced an atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local perspective what progress has been made six years after , in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( and / or , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light .
nevertheless , one still stri@@ ves to reloc@@ ate to final spare @-@ houses six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from shel@@ tered accommodation ( we , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees who were hau@@ led after the disaster in homes have been res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its gates until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools .
six years later it is certain that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have been largely affected .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farm@@ land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far back .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the accident . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it difficult to earn their living .
is the local population ready for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated ones . it asked them about the status of reconstruction and how their perception has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents think that there has still not been enough for disaster prevention .
what about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture also witnessed the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were en@@ graf@@ ted into durable replacement houses .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated countries are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being crushed by the police in national demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer hit him in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against his head .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied Social Sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the picture also shows the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military Police , in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás , announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active ministry until the end of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers as he hits the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ cri@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several gent@@ lemen ha@@ sten to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has repeatedly been divided into social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado encourages further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is witn@@ essing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here was the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stroke .
police re@@ ass@@ aults
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there were brutal police operations against prot@@ esters last Friday .
polic@@ emen were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a platform for or@@ ators , rubber shells and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce houses against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paolo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media handled street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window window .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paolo and Est@@ ado de S. Paolo deliberately reported on a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a burned bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic ground to report more about a broken window window than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a specific cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical atro@@ cities of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cuba &apos;s For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso Act , almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers in all Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no local sugar harvesting on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after gro@@ ping the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that are still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who is rising every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members perfectly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a subject of concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane plants were out@@ dated technically , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 c@@ ents ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to preserve the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially recorded documents , which differ@@ ed only to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still operating in operation , &quot; he assures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the disman@@ tling of the factory in which he helped .
with every part he removed he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ tops has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people who were present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane plants
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the popular church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ connect , they also stopped attacking the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were to be spar@@ ed .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand P@@ eso per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .

first Nations Youth use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; recording of a song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo taken with the approval of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 , in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ue David H@@ od@@ ges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop wi@@ dens that the young participants learn topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka State .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kitesur@@ fers &apos; First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group , who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in me
but I try to go on Earth my days
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they have appointed to the Creator .
in the commentary piece , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of Cre@@ e language also makes a contribution to Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au and adds the stop@@ per in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ic ( which is also published on his blog and published here with approval ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( s ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see plastic dishes nearly every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is precisely on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( or , &quot; Plas@@ tics models of dishes &quot; ) from every dish , which is served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small businesses that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bed tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition at Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part was made for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
you can look at other sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , where you &apos;ve got to .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which de@@ votes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes actually are made .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mi@@ sts and fat@@ alities often only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , forced the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico established the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is meant to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were caught in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the impact is far more profound .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ que que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches every weekend secret tom@@ bs for his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who in just one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we again prepare ourselves for the task we have set ourselves to seek and to search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are up to my father &apos;s insurance , but it doesn &apos;t pay them off because they charge a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
every day I come past newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he &apos;s big . and it is also not normal for people to hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they de@@ fy those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring country would be justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money from their business for month until they end not only destroying the business , but also torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain over that never passes away , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are away from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as you do not know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing his father &apos;s bloody cor@@ p@@ se shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organising crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Council of Public Safety and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office counted 3@@ 103 assass@@ inations . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 assass@@ inations per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the light of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in an understandable way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it is linked include pictures on which violence is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a ru@@ mor or expos@@ ing a fake .
but what about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication it has been deliberately used to cover trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , til@@ ting and explo@@ ding . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for many years and thus rav@@ aged . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pun@@ ches that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that .
government representatives described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people who looked at the football world championship .
houses burned and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident will depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the floor while individuals look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo was revi@@ ved several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the Army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image of the DR Congo turned up again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assur@@ ances in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comment@@ aries such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media to deliver arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were stro@@ kes , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , which brought together these descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , wrong@@ ly claimed , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DRC to view this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein Being that statement , but had not associated the image of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false links date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures of 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the pic@@ tured image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private pages , social media platforms and national and national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed on false reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have intim@@ ated examples of abuse and associated with the respective countries , on the basis of which page they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been connected with each other ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :

examples of false coupling of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ ted countries point to sites or servers that are still available in the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the grey countries are examples which , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( aimed at Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

even within Nigeria , the photograph of the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image of the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy of the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted to deli@@ mit , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judge on what they saw as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally fin@@ alized news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech are running and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
a ting@@ ling with a ting@@ ling or a ting@@ ling . &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted Th@@ ein Being in 2012 that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to be included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the ca@@ tho@@ lic near @-@ standing news site An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly stated that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later fell into circulation in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .

the image of the DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events taking place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence for the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the embassy in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .

frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently taken part in drinking water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and humili@@ ates the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equal to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images can des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media are working to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually also be solved by the context or completely mis@@ used .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into consideration how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons use according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog named un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer voice @-@ inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ br@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist@@ s stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - P@@ ick up your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rück language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they de@@ vote other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ using words &quot; and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya came across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of floo@@ ds and mud waves .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of stay .
rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas slowly went back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wa@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meter . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five will be completed to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about the flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year , after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ ating actions for people trapped by floo@@ ds and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need into security and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , while the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco on 21 January 2017 .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust in her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the burning .
in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next step , we apply rights to trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keeping the iconic image of a woman with sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others en@@ code slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run this conversation .
people I work with or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they dis@@ car@@ ded me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit into it , they will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
de@@ priv@@ ation of the body
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
to be at peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western world , Rum@@ is &apos;s religion was er@@ ased , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid put the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives are domin@@ ating our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens muscular women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave @-@ ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh &apos;s men and children become the goal of an@@ tim@@ us@@ ly attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ ethnic American .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants from 77 countries .
parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re @-@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were hurt Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an ins@@ ane Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - rather than get out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost forever for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already faulty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears the veil on a woman .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .
the author 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
use approved .
I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , see my rock in the surge , that I am a Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I was silent in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ing the Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Qur &apos;an and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to this is the picture of my grand@@ mother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they gain a competition in the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being a Muslim means speaking the prayers she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , which - over centuries - was colon@@ ized by an Empire , which established a company named Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to this means growing up and hearing that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my acc@@ ander@@ ed grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan conquered his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is knowing that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at play risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he was the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion are deeply rooted in our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ founded history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops station@@ ed over each continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy falls in the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt .
it means to know that about fourteen hundred years ago , the first cry of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim ban@@ ker .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals er@@ ect structural Islam hos@@ tility .
structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility exists in the Muslim regi@@ ments that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries that bomb it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and on the basis of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply tempted to include the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous prints that we put in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the pod@@ cast # good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multiply Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super @-@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we find ourselves .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me an un@@ miss@@ able Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
things that may evoke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may lie where one is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts that we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .
poster of the fac@@ ebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia studies network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be w@@ aged and people will be en@@ um@@ er@@ ated by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago , even scientist der Stan@@ ford was .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I in the rain did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , is telling stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS already held events since 2015 , there is the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project , the following applies :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often associated with it is to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpose these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to soci@@ alize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers write their story first in their own language and then translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and representation lead to the audience being en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed .
they evoke laugh@@ ing and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller , Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate , takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of telling her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the F@@ able from the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico demands re @-@ establishment of public debt from the US
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to USD 72 million , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the gr@@ ass@@ or@@ can Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the historic centre of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural testing of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical councils of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate remuneration that operates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will be at risk without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; completed books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective inqu@@ iry .
the book , published last year and is available free of charge , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression .
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how mo@@ tions for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with this .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what did we give up in this process of times extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Military Police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , they were contacted by people who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and who were informed of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototype was more predictable than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life trying to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ filed that she wrote to her husband during 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available licence @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the confin@@ es of the prison
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words
who I carry with my passion ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been imprisoned since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we repeat our call in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption jud@@ g@@ mental director after release on previous post
in anger , Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption case , in which a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half of his sentence in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed .
Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defend@@ ants in 2010 , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defend@@ ants .
the money came from public funds from Mozambique airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings following its imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not call this action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we take note is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary practice against the counter@@ acting .
however , the company was apparently silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; resist@@ ant &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent person , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had been served .
he could keep affordable lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to cause damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director had no moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already so mas@@ sively offen@@ ded the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality to return and serve the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served himself by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of the Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el prison . the Mozambique channel will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , sharp @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he energe@@ tically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of anything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he was 10 years old and was free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ ells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Bur@@ m@@ ese Script &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use , were cens@@ ored .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basically different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it solves all posts that are suspected of racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech receive a rather good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat demonstrated that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternate sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author informed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Khan believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it appears as if they started this without local context or technical support and thus banned words such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a great deal of sales , that would be great .
the automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but still have been removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where thousands of Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the frau@@ dul@@ ent hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at and learn more on context rather than focusing on code .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the nursery
a wedding ring in the sand .

the inf@@ ant is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ worthy age is now at 18 .
prior to this amend@@ ment to the Act , some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since the age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , which defines min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical bure@@ au of the country confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that endeav@@ ored to aboli@@ sh child marriage law followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
yet everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dar@@ ed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and at some point doubts sprang up if the opposition would agree with the bill in general .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the inf@@ ant was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft law against the inf@@ ant was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single one against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after it was previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ sted the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
following mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly talked about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft amend@@ ment to the Act was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were too opposed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inf@@ ant is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ proof .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible sn@@ ag comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps , the law was to be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate was different to the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that only panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce can cause us to speak instead of the problem that the state , our daughters from being ab@@ used by big , hard @-@ boiled men , who are compared to them , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child@@ care in various gra@@ dations is legal or the norm , although there are laws that they submit .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012 , opposite to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based En@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using stra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as reported recently in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform still remains locked , multiple mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) are found .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is accessible despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after having heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on putting sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pä@@ .org , a lun@@ atic site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ Pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked out .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub @-@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at mo@@ z@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal Fauna to the international stage .
and his home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what better give it to a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly in Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started taking pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know it , for he had already faced tig@@ ers face to face with face to face ,
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women avoid the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences should they dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community , after she had addressed a married relative to her name .
the tradition of not nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer allow@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the Camp@@ aig@@ n # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the bann@@ ing of HIV and AIDS infections , and leads this club .
it reports how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her round of discussion acted by women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women could easily identify with .
not speaking al@@ oud the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they have all du@@ ti@@ fully maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini said :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they do not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought their hus@@ bands &apos; names over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese in the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini said :
a woman was so shy that she was hiding only in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ alin to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead , indicating the mar@@ ital status :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ ced red point if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making an excursion during every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their life , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say some things al@@ oud , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ war cur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they have not dar@@ ed .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , morality linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it .
the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women ta@@ sted it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some people , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two women continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a river that is difficult to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was the right to find ( Beat@@ les Day ) in the Japanese t@@ witter @-@ trend with many fans inter@@ rog@@ ating memories and sharing their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in the year 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noticed in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese run through .
the people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . we &apos;ve been here 51 years ago in Tokyo .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survived all .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places associated with the band .
if you love The Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( V@@ om Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
the Beat@@ les arrived in Japan exactly today in 1966 .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
and of course some companies also make use of the fan community market @-@ based , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to Y@@ ester@@ day today and eat r@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope that you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of young people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ton , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they stood for the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on smooth @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 Mission in the South African country to study this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
be@@ ware of bald men who travel to Mozambique for bald men are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police warned about the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ton district , where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ une in the south of Mozambique , said the local police were already pursuing the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of small @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of its organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans , this involves the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bed ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head had power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men were murdered with loss of hair in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like to join E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME A country where people would be ashamed to engage in sex against good marks , and to depri@@ ve students of good marks , work and other achievements , a nation where people would not viol@@ ate honest pursu@@ its or even steal their lives , a country where neither the al@@ bino nor bald or bald can be hun@@ ted for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our .
Z@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ aic authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of gl@@ atz@@ ber people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak deeply sincere con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ lan &apos;s wife , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that she was contacted by people who own themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
bas@@ ins St@@ ay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials found out that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we will turn to the creation of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the Open Web @-@ movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have campaig@@ ned for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , and the Syrian Network for Human Rights organisation has disappeared .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , not less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community on the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to leave or permit him to treat abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ dened the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press sums up some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations was supposed to put pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway Finn@@ mark of Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions on Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon smu@@ g@@ gling to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions from Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the news agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the call of the US Embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China was supposed to offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o to embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u Ad@@ voc@@ ate told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ es the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights .
France and France
on 29 June , the State Department of France called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually record it .
Taiwan University of Taiwan
the Council of State Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation of Li@@ u on June 28 and indicated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international scale .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister stated that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he is supporting Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist logic &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of fle@@ eing the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in the face of that , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are run permanently by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old Ly@@ re emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the answers to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were really non @-@ rep@@ lies to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he made corresponding questions with non @-@ answers ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore isn &apos;t a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to resolve this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing An@@ on on the blog his commentary , he points out concerning the critics that one should start reading the complete tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even when we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is really associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integrates the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believed a fault &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a wrong speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country do the sovereign rights of the City of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
as he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore pay their military service , but do they defend their city but not their country ?
who does our Prime Minister have to pay back invoices ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the city &apos;s defense .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans maybe cook internally against anger if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differ from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag very visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all lovers of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ les on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
with us , there are no weapons !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means being sk@@ e@@ ful - like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau betra@@ yed the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ises Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ dates the j@@ un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and re@@ stores the civil government in spite of its promise to continue to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video nevertheless refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular about the situation of the country under j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos , which relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered as critics by the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also set up to supervis@@ e online content and prosec@@ ute persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict attitude against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; majority ins@@ ult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment store , another problem .
some journalists are in jail , because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ anarch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic War has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ ava are located in the reser@@ vo@@ irs of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet era .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians are living in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ovo , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were parish centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping , and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the District Administration offers free candles and bread for the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial support from her daughter and ins@@ ist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is dealing with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .

G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist , Nat@@ ascha , lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply broken away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , told Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast start calling them : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy medicines they can &apos;t pay them , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are talking about Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always be in contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they went away to greet her or to tell her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family recorded immigrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela says he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to make money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him a roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is back full of guests .
the travellers quietly look at their teleph@@ ones in the hall@@ ways .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving , she has made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
she laughs mour@@ ning while she presents her briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Communication it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , authorities should also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would determine and prosec@@ ute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark@@ er for those living in distant , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures , as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( Julius Ex@@ pos . ) , which published cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ eman in@@ discrimin@@ ately checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert asked people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting in the software being able to lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the city council &apos;s instructions to minim@@ ise the dissemination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated organisations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the Cyber@@ security Office &apos;s instructions on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , the authorities issued a decree to allow all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police station until August 1 .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissi@@ p@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality cat@@ ches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ d . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but it was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Council formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stuff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down something after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof several times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations fully and completely .
at such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust what to look into your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was due to my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure to myself when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed c@@ law suits me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ran through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I will detail all details carefully before I enter the room .
otherwise they have given me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one further prisoner and let me sit right away , without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating his fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ com@@ rade was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Savi@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no striking features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive all these crow@@ s that are lab@@ elled at the fruit in my head garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light presented to us by the horror in person : the wheel ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be inter@@ rog@@ ated . &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that eman@@ ate from him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those days thi@@ eves and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I am used to not answering .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when ins@@ ults and blows become an ordinary communication tool for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I did not do anything to deserve this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this loving &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er shall delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the pipe with a cable .
at my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped shou@@ ting .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not like it , which is why he acted as the next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed that occurred to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terrible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep yourself , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he changes to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips fl@@ aked with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the upper@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ lows ( e.g. Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority , ques@@ tioning their old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years of experience , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limitations in his mind , and according to his own statement he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluc@@ t@@ ance to US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sp@@ ans in water @-@ soluble Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the slo@@ pp@@ ings of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sw@@ ath of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just as drinking water in the public during Ram@@ adan , in order not to land in prison .
recently , Jord@@ ani@@ ens , the Ministry of Interior , cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ bearer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also argue that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old @-@ time legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to choose &quot; intellec@@ tuals and cul@@ turally pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simple rhet@@ oric but actually reflect an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b submitted traditional gender norms to bodies by em@@ power@@ ing his vision of the fate of Arab women having sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a seemingly de@@ vili@@ fied unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch right up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &quot; honorary mor@@ alities &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still complic@@ ating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law bann@@ ing crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can be det@@ ained for in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known not to shy away from topics that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics was given to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated remark@@ ably often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the rest of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hatred or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn from the context , distorted and his opinions were cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed , but only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b campaigns for the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet from the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
there is nothing new in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
even more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government members and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had vo@@ iced criticism on social media comment@@ aries on the problems related to the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan did not stop M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , street uni@@ tions and artificial manner of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ ula in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ ula festivals .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ e@@ ders , drums and dancing come across more than one thousand years ago and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi .
we are at the Neb@@ ula Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to s@@ nat@@ ch a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula Festival is the only real one - and a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

out@@ ward appearance and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more regular citizens into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has inspired even an annual event , the dres@@ sage competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get a training in hair style instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community .

isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
it was precisely this question that the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation did not leave the head and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la gran@@ ul@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla bands .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it . after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the point of departure for the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock had their weapons with them , must now return to life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply entr@@ en@@ ched to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , must now take up its ranks and support it in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans should join together and help in the process of integration .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ llas to welcome them back to society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC did as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ ri@@ llas lived ) , I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him quite firmly and seated me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sick of the war too , was tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up and the F@@ ARC existed already in secret .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC issued the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of this magnitude , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and recognizing that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters also only people with beautiful feelings which were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former comb@@ at@@ ants responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms , lift themselves up and protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will have many difficulties ahead .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya over the past few months .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community does not come into being only over night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya captured the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ figure , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she eventually moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a voluntary hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day someone was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who entered into trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her anywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the lap by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ and@@ stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the last analysis .
apparently some women had got everything together and started to scre@@ am .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got dr@@ ones .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and a few distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me I had to prove it by running on the streets without passing through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that all was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened the third time , I realized that something was la@@ zy .
my fellow human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , that is a tab@@ oo subject .
some of the traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian items I still carry in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this emotional barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when chat@@ ting with the camera , I really struggle to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who are d@@ ull ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had settled in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate now on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood recovery .
OC Media : are there still gay men trapped in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not very many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives in order to put themselves to the Court .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but di@@ pped in a targeted manner in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ards have grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . we assume however that such actions are quite possible .
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I have always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
in the end , Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; civili@@ sation , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , carried dresses and short tops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never curved a hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ort not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children , when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yeah .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at once with suspici@@ on .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic was steadily worse .
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ps , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people myself when I picked off the type of shelter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature , that has nothing to do with religion at all .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to teach you foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ers have which ones who have Kab@@ ard@@ ines , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about a transition to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide inside the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fall@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless due to the persecution by the Iranian government , and in@@ capable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi living in Iran is based , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population has little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime refuses to systematically deny the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arabian areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co @-@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their native Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first name and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and so be stopped , as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement auth@@ ored by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all feminine in general .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I suffer double and triple under it .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists choose to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; raise their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement as black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injus@@ tices in her mind , which relate to both sex and skin color .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to justify an ideology in which the black woman is an un@@ men@@ ac@@ ed and margin@@ alized being in a historic sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and sex . some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women different backgrounds a home and to de@@ mar@@ cate from white femin@@ ism there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than using myself for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embar@@ k on the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports special about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
this article will be published once again as part of a content sharing agreement .
again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oeing - with a particular concern for the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a kid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil .
the focus of her work lies on neglected , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by the cur@@ ative . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # mul@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her adver@@ t .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence have to report to the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 Tem@@ ples and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that contains nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays legislation : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ gy@@ ms , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , which , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads reported by the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . there were also 86 % of women &apos;s ads .
in the ads 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; every woman in Paraguay has been ref@@ unded for psych@@ ic abuse will come 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every woman ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violent acts by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this should regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on fac@@ ebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen so long ago by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as Adverti@@ sements by the Auth@@ orities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support .
it led a process against its former partner , who developed into an imper@@ vious legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paraguay Law : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ on@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ ini@@ d has to declare an independent criminal record and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the wording of the law was changed in some respects to also win the MPs for the law which feared that the path to de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft bill fores@@ ees most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence have to bear right now if they simply furnis@@ h display and want to receive safe accommodation to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so violence is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who keep silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are being punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must pay such a long time display until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence were calling for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been blocked due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available on the website of the For@@ bidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later they came free again .
Oman is ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Sa@@ ï@@ d since 1970 , who came to power after he had settled his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , he held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including media freedom , freedom of press , journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , intim@@ id@@ ate and incar@@ n@@ ate .
the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a tough blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , Security Forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article entitled &quot; High Level Parties &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . it was about corruption in judicial proceedings and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court judges in Oman to cancel a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high ranking parties tie hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : fac@@ ebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS arrested Deputy Chief Editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dissemination of the paper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in Mas@@ k@@ at in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &quot; imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 Palestinian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year ban of occupation was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
he was arrested for Al @-@ Abr@@ i in the amount of 5,000 US dollars ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the arrest of his six @-@ month jail sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he served his first @-@ year cust@@ odi@@ al sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to go again , the paper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister appointed himself another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further violations , for example , include closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Afgh@@ an authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and association as well as the right to gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is given with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : firstly , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research conducted by African scientists is helping to build independent research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , where the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( disclaim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a creator himself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to come here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenge here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system , that magazines are only accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding .
the patents applied not only for single varieties but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or leaf@@ y leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or car@@ rots . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food security concern the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it takes longer because his work gets more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I must p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that right now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he continues as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the US and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it is tested to see whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area comes from and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties , and not to cut it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the em@@ eri@@ fied professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg control over the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the nutrition system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes care of the ever more frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture sector , whose recent examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide their seeds with free access to seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all car@@ rots characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult to use .
for other plants , there are still no such estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by assume that large @-@ scale plants like wheat are still patented as a salad or car@@ rot .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more important than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are far less predictable .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture set the company for the conservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property protects other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not in@@ hibit innovations , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mort@@ on looks different : wait for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the battle .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are required to grow her@@ b@@ ici@@ des in order to grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that are moving to international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) possess patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on also believes that breeders through the avoid@@ ance of plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that pat@@ enting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent , one is protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide Reson@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , carries out an &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Organization Agre@@ emen is working on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding are different from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it is against the current practice of the European Patent Office that patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is still not a law ; it is now time for the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for the next year &apos;s official launch .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context by which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hoped that more people will soon be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid particular attention to where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ DR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - in spite of this attack and the distortion of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now .
FE@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era from Qatar on the basis of &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web@@ side barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ O@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of articles and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he established in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which Zi@@ p@@ blog is also resident , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about student protests and took a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; A arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the block@@ age of blogs and any other website I worked for .
2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 pages from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , such as Orange , V@@ od@@ af@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of vendors , through the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practices indicate the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which has no legal basis for the Egyptian population , with which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

newspapers throughout Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to many postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the force of violence in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non@@ governmental organization Global Justice also called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper thus explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 sites controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the paper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ acent negl@@ ect of public service .
remember@@ ing : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country , according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is located at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
specially owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia emphasized , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police unit and permanently station@@ ing one unit .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for a number of years , however , after several reports about har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which the newly created police unit should actually protect , is increasingly being bombar@@ ded .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the human being .
this calls for the state to use resources and ways typical of a war . this includes intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a ci@@ vi@@ list is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; irr@@ ational spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio will continue to suffer .
it is a week ago that the police cleared up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly severely affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition , based on the United Nations and other human rights organisations , are assuming that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside of Damascus have been under siege , which resulted in local residents being dependent on locally produced or tunnels and control points .
thanks to the many years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving source of food . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
comm@@ enting on the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , opposite the French News Agency AF@@ P , said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining promin@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to raise funds for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ seam .
it is planned to teach 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before testing their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger bath . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to extract new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on October 21 and called for justice for the victims of fires that were gra@@ zing in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 erup@@ tions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Forest Super@@ vision System , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
whole Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos are spread on the web and show images that allow for better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal stated the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a widespread proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity of case to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , become more and more expan@@ sive , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Ci@@ vili@@ zation of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ ile and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ ga@@ des and was so crucial in October this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the G@@ haz@@ ni province in central Afghanistan last time together with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say that then , she knew her son would not see her son any longer - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ protected .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara for@@ so@@ ok the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
for some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which distributed food to the needy two times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high levels of welcome . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum -@@ which may take months after registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ brid@@ led lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af set his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari inaugurated the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Padua and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals extend far beyond the Italian hospitality sector and retailers , and return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily , if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and cann@@ ing techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
notes report : bills from Egypt allow dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .
he reported on the clearing of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament scrut@@ ini@@ zes a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority .
users must register to use social networks within six months following the successful decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and their ID number .
anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or fin@@ alisation of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently in charge of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may a further MP filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er sanctions would be introduced to ins@@ ult the president or a high civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law , however , such a deed would be punished by j@@ ails and fin@@ es , such as the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , it may mean three years in prison for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger anyway for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the res@@ ignation of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in jail for four years in jail for more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ aches of inter alia weapons collection , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists hear scanned documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours inter@@ rog@@ ating Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was heard chi@@ ef@@ ly by an in@@ gest@@ ed action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all the illeg@@ ally received mon@@ ies .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April raises a light on how the pres@@ si@@ cal plans to support the legislative proposal look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the name of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness .
is China trying to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
the rules also indicate that the registration with the full name will be required .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed social media to only sel@@ ectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information dissemination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for removing content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ Classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wikipedia &apos;s Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data sent to Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was closed because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups in order to make a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is therefore , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop having sni@@ ff@@ ed
this week , the United Kingdom government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telec@@ om operators and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior .
