<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, had read American writers and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a deep-reaching effect on me, that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method One," "" "I was like this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only amplified my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very fanatical love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number ever achieved by the Party nominally.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was dumbfounded.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, who takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trumps Weltanschauung agreed not with the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "", "the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhaga and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Goldey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice gave me a lot of help in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump faced his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to label the Trump voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to elevate a man looking with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note.): as much as "white against all the other ethnicities," pun from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means much like skidding trauma), as the Great Van Jones said has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality - it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country has chosen as its president, twice the son of a Kenyanist whose story, as he says himself, would be nowhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vociferous" "" "NO!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for whom his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trumps land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in Oaxaca Province recorded with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the garbage</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (musical band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest to Vicente Guerrero's church in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for young people.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village which is practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, made up of local solid waste materials, is made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "the" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before seeking the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal prosecutor of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to drank one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior manager of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia, due to pillage of the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Besides Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries, who at that time had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo with which information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one has noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly even if they have a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay fines, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa while supporting FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world, including those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as coasting under false flag, counterfeit license papers, phantasies, fish protected species and fish in conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-seamless control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could then say 'You mustn't run my harbor'." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and just this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be located by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protective Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally by means of the position of every single traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which had previously been fishing without licence and hardly had any consequences, know now that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in the FISH trade show a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, inspectors found towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With security the aim is to let more such initiatives and structures develop in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first grand triumph: in October it set Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used tow nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greco 1 set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world ocean.

<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the resignation, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the order of Venezuela) both images of these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being held in other parts of the country, among others in the Barinas locality, in the regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centre-north of Carabobo and Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continuously deteriorates, which makes itself felt in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute shortage of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro; ultimately, the position of re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-contributor at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The opposition rally Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Party) in which the opposition parties and political groups were joined together, the demonstrators were calling for a mass rally to support the National Assembly, which was planned for the election of 2015, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, on November 3.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3rd November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="177">Especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of TÃ¡chira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic opens the round, which forms the scale of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official concession - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview from Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Cordoba city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was investigated for crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was ok.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you don't realize that you are being manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerist. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-appearing daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it result in such an English translation?" ""</seg>

<seg id="357">The fecture of Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people were offended by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awfully" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of elderly motorists, which are implicated in accidents across the country, is a cause of concern." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this way, a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, who could translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers, who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations into the company. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is assessed as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and puzzling phrases that originate through machine translations show that this technique can not replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for a number of languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weirdest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vivoplay online broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups that resist the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a tracer. he pointed out that the connection was appalled and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activate your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that web pages of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ vivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures, if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission looked at it as "calling for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinsufftro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web page is blocked by the DNS, the server responds poorly or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ vPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelan access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she, from which something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she began to work as a criadita for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to afford countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the Crimean is generally still silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with her and justifies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will know about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was criadita in the household of the former military belonging to TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira went on with a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered lethal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the Criadazgo's practice rooted deep in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos was widely spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The couple's neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a speedy study of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be directional - if Paraguay's case is a case of Criadazgo before the court for the first time in the history of Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="457">Her brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n as Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose at five o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday, for example, she cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">"" "Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food too." "" "I was allowed to take more books from the library of the house than eating out of the fridge," "" "she recalls." ""</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">"" "on some evenings the host Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as" "" "Sendero" "" "or" "" "El Pueblo" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to not believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent, but didn't talk to her." "" "the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't allow me to visit my family often because they felt I would" learn bad habits "there again." they meant that Alvarenga, which belongs to the Indigenous group of Guarani, would once again speak their mother tongue GuaranÃ­.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">"" "Alvarenga was also discriminated at school." "" "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and harassment that are exposed to Crimean when they go to school." ""</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to my home. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships evolve, I especially felt that I was not a group.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not give notice to how Egyptian authorities should account for the registration. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopards, which strives through Africa and Asia, are among the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less loot.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the conservative daily Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "threefold disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. the Prefecture of Miyagi was one of the prefectures of Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami resulting from it.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had made whole coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima experienced an atomic accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local perspective what progress has been made six years after, in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, 77 percent of the planned spare parts (and / or, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima represents 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one still strives to relocate to final spare-houses six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from sheltered accommodation (we, casetsu juutaku).</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who were hauled after the disaster in homes have been resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by misfortune have opened its gates until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is certain that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have been largely affected.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farmland destroyed by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the accident. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants find it difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population ready for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated ones. it asked them about the status of reconstruction and how their perception has changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that there has still not been enough for disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture also witnessed the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were engrafted into durable replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas, most of the evacuated countries are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking different languages, the differences seem to be larger than similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that a more united than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, broaden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we are looking exactly to these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices, who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherr explains how a migration had consolidated her affection for the Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied Social Sciences at the German University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The picture also shows the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>

<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Descrializador," a media channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net, where you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several gentlemen hasten to him.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of Ãlvaro Reynoso Act, almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers in all Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no local sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After groping the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting daily to the factories that are still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who is rising every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation again because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers perfectly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a subject of concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane plants were outdated technically, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 cents (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" "" "deceit." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to preserve the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially recorded documents, which differed only to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014, in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop widens that the young participants learn topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska State.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the kitesurfers' First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on Earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have appointed to the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes nearly every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is precisely on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (or, "Plastics models of dishes") from every dish, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small businesses that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend now turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic ribbed tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerators for a new exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part was made for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can look at other scurrile plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, where you've got to.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which devotes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the extremists and fatalities often only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, forced the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico established the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which is meant to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were caught in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vique que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how Fear lives" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come past newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) when he's big. and it is also not normal for people to hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they defy those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring country would be justified by being" "" "soaked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to argue that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family with threats has been plundered." it describes how armed criminals squeezed money from their business for month until they end not only destroying the business, but also torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over that never passes away, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as you do not know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, tortillas warm and make "chi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing his father's bloody corpse shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organising crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Council of Public Safety and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor's Office counted 3103 assassinations. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 assassinations per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the light of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in an understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>

<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for many years and thus ravaged. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of punches that were difficult to navigate.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the floor while individuals look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was revived several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained behind to count corpses," "" "said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the Army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image of the DR Congo turned up again when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented assurances in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal commentaries such as this example falsely relate the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who could flee were strokes, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, which brought together these descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, wrongly claimed, the President Myanmars Thein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DRC to view this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are umpteen people who have inadvertently taken part in drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and humiliates the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equal to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images can desensitise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media are working to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually also be solved by the context or completely misused.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into consideration how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog named untranslatable (e.g. unsurpassable) endeavours to offer voice-inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>

<seg id="947">But all resists stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Pick up your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the HunsrÃ¼ck language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, is telling stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS already held events since 2015, there is the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" listening "" "" often associated with it is to understand "" "" purpose these events instead "" "" to appreciate, to feel, to socialize. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers write their story first in their own language and then translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation lead to the audience being encircled.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughing and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso that is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller, Rassidatou Konate, takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of telling her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the Fable from the rabbit and the baboon in Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to USD 72 million, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started at the grassorcan Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the historic centre of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neural testing of debt) and the ecumenical councils of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debt are responsible for their corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available free of charge, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how motions for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create a sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of times extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the" "" "Military Police" "" "Bassel had taken on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, they were contacted by people who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and who were informed of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototype was more predictable than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life trying to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a profiled that she wrote to her husband during 2012-2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available licence-free.</seg>

<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora titled "It happens":</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ourselves,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That I don't care about any of the dangers,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the confines of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I will enter into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Who I carry with my passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>

<seg id="1239">To bring back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have been imprisoned since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our call in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption judgmental director after release on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">In anger, Mozambique reacted to a corruption case, in which a member of the government returned to the state apparatus after half of his sentence in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants in 2010, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings following its imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not call this action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary practice against the counteracting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was apparently silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, an important voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "resistant":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep affordable lectures and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza likes to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director had no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already so massively offended the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">"" "" "" "Cambaza lacks morality to return and serve the state." "" "he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served himself by the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are part of the Samora Mahel prison. the Mozambique channel will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, sharp-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he energetically confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of anything, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious person is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpeas or spells." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "(Burmese Script" "" ") as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with basically different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalaraar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it solves all posts that are suspected of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example," "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech receive a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "now it is time to circumcise their nationalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat demonstrated that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternate spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to extinguish his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"" "" "" "Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nationalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author informed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khan believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"" "" "" "Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work." ""</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it appears as if they started this without local context or technical support and thus banned words such as" "" "Chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">The automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but still have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, heal people then?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine where thousands of Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the fraudulent hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at and learn more on context rather than focusing on code.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to ban this practice, so that the age-worthy age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this amendment to the Act, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since the age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Children's Rights, which defines minors as" "" "every person under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical bureau of the country confirmed that in 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavored to abolish child marriage law followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Yet everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should, dared to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provided tensions in this actually uncomplicated cause, and at some point doubts sprang up if the opposition would agree with the bill in general.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the infant was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him act.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">"" "Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat:" "" "the draft law against the infant was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not a single one against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">"" "" "" "the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who held a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which disgusted the core of the matter, but do you know what? the toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Following mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly talked about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft amendment to the Act was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There were 41 members of the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present in the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "all deputies who were too opposed have voted for the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The infant is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childproof.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who challenged him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thanks to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible snag comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps, the law was to be passed, and he seems to redeem his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al-rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate, if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished that the debate was different to the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion as general, in a way that only panic and arrogance can cause us to speak instead of the problem that the state, our daughters from being abused by big, hard-boiled men, who are compared to them, would be misused, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the childcare in various gradations is legal or the norm, although there are laws that they submit.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012, opposite to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally dark.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy Internet users are used to using strapping tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as reported recently in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform still remains locked, multiple mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is accessible despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything on putting snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopÃ¤.org, a lunatic site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar MirrorPages when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked out.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Sub-hashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that which you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A subelender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal Fauna to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what better give it to a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly in Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started taking pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know it, for he had already faced tigers face to face with face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid the utmost care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences should they disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community, after she had addressed a married relative to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of not naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer allowances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, entered a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the Campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paese has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children's marriage to the banning of HIV and AIDS infections, and leads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her round of discussion acted by women who don't call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women could easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not speaking aloud the name of their husbands is a custom, which they have all dutifully maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply entrenched that we never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they do not respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought their husbands' names over their lips," "" "says Rohini Paese in the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was hiding only in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenalin to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinced red dot on the forehead, indicating the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinced red point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are making an excursion during every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, for the first time in their life, they celebrated their own birthdays with cake; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say some things aloud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted a Salwar curta to wear a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morality linked to the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion has already changed, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some people, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a river that is difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29 of this year, the hashtag was the right to find (Beatles Day) in the Japanese twitter-trend with many fans interrogating memories and sharing their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in the year 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noticed in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to make the Japanese run through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"" "the music of the cult band is" "" "more than just a universal language like English," "" "said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review." ""</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning!! today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan. we've been here 51 years ago in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survived all.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll should represent John Lennon or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the famous places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love The Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>

<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (Vom Link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">The Beatles arrived in Japan exactly today in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same we did last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also make use of the fan community market-based, such as this Ramen-Shop (Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of young people for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelieving purposes, concerns the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milton, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and a part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they stood for the use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police officer of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on smooth-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 Mission in the South African country to study this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Beware of bald men who travel to Mozambique for bald men are the target of ritualistic attacks, the Mozambican police warned about the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the Milton district, where the killings took place.</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of small-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of its organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional shamans, this involves the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bed (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head had power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men were murdered with loss of hair in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook, Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blogger's poor Snaippa, who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state threat) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China referred Lius case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, to leave or permit him to treat abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely widened the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press sums up some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations was supposed to put pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway Finnmark of Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions on Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon smuggling to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as stated in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions from Mr. Liu's wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the news agency AFP announced on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the call of the US Embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley informed that China was supposed to offer the couple the following:</seg>

<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported to the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vortex could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide adequate medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu Advocate told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervises the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, the State Department of France called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually record it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan University of Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of State Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation of Liu on June 28 and indicated that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed the Charter, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 domain public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international scale.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister stated that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He is supporting Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalierio blog accused the Minister of Justice to "twist logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of fleeing the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in the face of that, he seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are run permanently by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old Lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-replies to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He made corresponding questions with non-answers rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore isn't a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to resolve this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing Anon on the blog his commentary, he points out concerning the critics that one should start reading the complete transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven when we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is really associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weaknesses of Shanmugam's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam has" "" "believed a fault" "" "or was it a wrong speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country do the sovereign rights of the City of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore pay their military service, but do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister have to pay back invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The journal Journey of a Decade tends to be Bejahung, Singapore and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country above all" "", "but that is not quite right." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the city's defense.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked its editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a continuous series, with rumors about certain parts of the world exposed and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, Editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "the question I asked most in Japan is:" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I answered." "" "I'm from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification then usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians maybe cook internally against anger if they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that Canadians differ from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag very visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All lovers of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little maples on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">With us, there are no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>

<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"" "we obviously say very often" "" "excuse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends that I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"" "but there are also some problems with the stamp" "" "nice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, being called "nice," basically means being skeful - like the benign, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has an own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau betrayed the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our Prime Minister made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that parodates the junta, which took power in 2014 and restores the civil government in spite of its promise to continue to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"" "the new song" "" "Dictator Girl" "" "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes." ""</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video nevertheless refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">"" "last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" "" "Der dictator" "" "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called the public to watch this video." ""</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular about the situation of the country under junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos, which relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit in the army was also set up to supervise online content and prosecute persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand sets a strict attitude against" "" "read Majeste" "" "(" "" "majority insult" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment store, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in jail, because they are supposed to have caused "confusion" in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the song showed members of the band who imitated the Salut of "The Hunger Games," which was already used by Putsch-opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchassic War has been officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchava are located in the reservoirs of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asia-Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden earrings in teddy bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, told Ms RamÃ­rez, the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast start calling them:" "" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy medicines they can't pay them, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>

<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are talking about Mrs. RamÃ­rez on Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they went away to greet her or to tell her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family recorded immigrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela says he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>

<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to make money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">The travellers quietly look at their telephones in the hallways.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair weaving, she has made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users in the high-quality language.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the town of Urumqi receive a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the Communication it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, authorities should also use the app for more than combating terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would determine and prosecute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting about digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, reality is very often darker for those living in distant, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures, as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (Julius Expos.), which published censored news in China, displayed photos from a checkpoint where policeman indiscriminately checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a Jingwang product description, resulting in the software being able to lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the city council's instructions to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated organisations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the Cybersecurity Office's instructions on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a decree to allow all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police station until August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos," however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he changes to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips flaked with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the uppermost floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as fellows (e.g. Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority, questioning their old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years of experience, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limitations in his mind, and according to his own statement he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special reluctance to US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he spans in water-soluble NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young ag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the sloppings of lukewarm coffee and the swath of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just as drinking water in the public during Ramadan, in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordaniens, the Ministry of Interior, cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-bearer, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also argue that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to choose "intellectuals and culturally pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simple rhetoric but actually reflect an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib submitted traditional gender norms to bodies by empowering his vision of the fate of Arab women having sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a seemingly devilified unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch right up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of "honorary moralities" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still complicating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law banning crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can be detained for indefinite time in prison, "and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known not to shy away from topics that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics was given to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santorano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated remarkably often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the rest of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hatred or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to memorize that his comments were torn from the context, distorted and his opinions were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed, but only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib campaigns for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet from the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuvo, who was to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">There is nothing new in the Hashemite Kingdom that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even more recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government members and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had voiced criticism on social media commentaries on the problems related to the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan did not stop Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and inner changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, street unitions and artificial manner of democracies. at least he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebula in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebula festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feeders, drums and dancing come across more than one thousand years ago and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebula Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snatch a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebula Festival is the only real one - and a breathtaking way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outward appearance and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more regular citizens into the hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has inspired even an annual event, the dressage competition "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get a training in hair style instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine" "" "Tea After Twelve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">It was precisely this question that the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation did not leave the head and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la granulaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla bands.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it. after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the point of departure for the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before Colombians there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock had their weapons with them, must now return to life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply entrenched to guerrilla warfare, must now take up its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians should join together and help in the process of integration.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC did as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," said the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where the guerrillas lived), I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and seated me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sick of the war too, was tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up and the FARC existed already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC issued the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of this magnitude, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and recognizing that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters also only people with beautiful feelings which were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former combatants responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms, lift themselves up and protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will have many difficulties ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who entered into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her anywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the lap by WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a men's voice saying, "Here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonour the family, you scandstain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything together and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time on his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got drones.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and a few distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me I had to prove it by running on the streets without passing through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I didn't change my sex, that all was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My fellow human rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you're in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, that is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some of the traditionally Caucasian items I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this emotional barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When chatting with the camera, I really struggle to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who are dull?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had settled in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate now on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men trapped in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives in order to put themselves to the Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but dipped in a targeted manner in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beards have grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. we assume however that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I have always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In the end, Russia wanted to introduce us to the "civilisation," but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, carried dresses and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never curved a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole town knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Sort not about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yeah.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily on the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed before looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic was steadily worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreps, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"" "" "" "I discovered these people myself when I picked off the type of shelter." ""</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to teach you foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestaners have which ones who have Kabardines, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about a transition to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability for his family, so Ahwazi-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Fallah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless due to the persecution by the Iranian government, and incapable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi living in Iran is based, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population has little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refuses to systematically deny the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arabian areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for co-operatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside their native Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and so be stopped, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, also with the intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement authored by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminine in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer double and triple under it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists choose to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "raise their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement as black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which relate to both sex and skin color.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to justify an ideology in which the black woman is an unmenaced and marginalized being in a historic sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex. some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women different backgrounds a home and to demarcate from white feminism there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embark on the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"" "" "" "I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither skipped nor ignored, nor rejected." ""</seg>

<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another Mrs. Balbuena showed due to maltreatment, Ada BÃ¡ez did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her advert.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence have to report to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Temples and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that contains nothing undernimmt3 Paraguays legislation: good approach, deficient implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Egyms, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports, which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were 9600 advertisements for domestic violence at the District Attorney Office. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads reported by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. there were also 86% of women's ads.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually shown. "every woman in Paraguay has been refunded for psychic abuse will come 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "every woman refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violent acts by men.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then gave up. this should regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long ago by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is given with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: firstly, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research conducted by African scientists is helping to build independent research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, where the AIDS epidemic showed a serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a creator himself.</seg>

<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to come here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenge here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system, that magazines are only accessible for payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredgeous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for single varieties but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or leafy leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or carrots. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security concern the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it takes longer because his work gets more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I must paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that right now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce because all the features are already patented. "so he continues as well as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the US and throughout the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the Outredgeous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. it is tested to see whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area comes from and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties, and not to cut it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerified professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg control over the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the nutrition system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes care of the ever more frequent mergers in the global agriculture sector, whose recent examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer. "whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide their seeds with free access to seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all carrots characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are still no such estimates, but experts such as Luby assume that large-scale plants like wheat are still patented as a salad or carrot.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more important than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are far less predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture set the company for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property protects other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovations, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: wait for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant features:" "" "we don't really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required to grow herbicides in order to grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that are moving to international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) possess patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders through the avoidance of plant patents would be more innovative: "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years," "" "he says." "" "with a patent, one is protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion." "" "worldwide Resonance" ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, carries out an "open source" seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agreemen is working on an open-source licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding are different from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot be easily taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it is against the current practice of the European Patent Office that patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "however, an explanation is still not a law; it is now time for the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for Open Source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for the next year's official launch.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed-map map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a varied local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context by which Luby von Ossi hoped that more people will soon be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid particular attention to where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," "" "says Luby." "" "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANDRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - in spite of this attack and the distortion of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">FEHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera from Qatar on the basis of "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of webside barriers to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmODS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of articles and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established in order to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which Zipblog is also resident, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about student protests and took a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada expressed himself to the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; A arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blockage of blogs and any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 pages from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), such as Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of vendors, through the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which has no legal basis for the Egyptian population, with which they can proceed to court against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo of: Estado Maior (CML) via photos PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Newspapers throughout Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to many postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "" "Thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the force of violence in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian nongovernmental organization Global Justice also called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "in this way, the newspaper" Extra "" "" known for detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial "" "" This is not normal "" "," in which she announced a new section called "" "" War in Rio "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 sites controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to obscure atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is arguing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remembering: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to the statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country, according to the statistics of 2015, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio is located at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Specially owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia emphasized, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unida de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police unit and permanently stationing one unit.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for a number of years, however, after several reports about harassment and repression against the poor communities, which the newly created police unit should actually protect, is increasingly being bombarded.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use resources and ways typical of a war. this includes intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilist is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "irrational spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is a week ago that the police cleared up the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly severely affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition, based on the United Nations and other human rights organisations, are assuming that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside of Damascus have been under siege, which resulted in local residents being dependent on locally produced or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Thanks to the many years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how to plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving source of food."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Commenting on the project, Abo Nabil, opposite the French News Agency AFP, said:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more" "" "gaining prominence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to raise funds for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alseam.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about 12,700 â¬, but will continue to raise donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started" "" "production of mushroom seeds from the regions" "", "before testing their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a bigger bath. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on October 21 and called for justice for the victims of fires that were grazing in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October. this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 eruptions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European Forest Supervision System, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can take a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire-fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral from the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal stated the paper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened again as in June, as the roads were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A widespread proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "" "" "the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed the construction activity of case to fall if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," "" "adds JoÃ£o Sorval in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico." ""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly inflammable wood, become more and more expansive, as in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civilization of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used the own civil protection data using the application fogos.ile and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigades and was so crucial in October this fateful weekend in October that the server did not withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the Ghazni province in central Afghanistan last time together with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say that then, she knew her son would not see her son any longer - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">For some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church which distributed food to the needy two times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high levels of welcome. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially have submitted an application for asylum -which may take months after registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled lifeblood helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf set his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari inaugurated the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashark's goals extend far beyond the Italian hospitality sector and retailers, and return to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily, if I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and canning techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament scrutinizes a draft bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months following the successful decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or finalisation of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently in charge of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "may a further MP filed a legislative proposal in which tougher sanctions would be introduced to insult the president or a high civil servant." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law, however, such a deed would be punished by jails and fines, such as the legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, it may mean three years in prison for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger anyway for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the resignation of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "Shawkan was waiting for four years in jail for four years in jail for more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident." ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May, because according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, headaches of inter alia weapons collection, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists hear scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours interrogating Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was heard chiefly by an ingested action plan. said plan stems from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all the illegally received monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April raises a light on how the pressical plans to support the legislative proposal look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia leaned the name of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Is China trying to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that the registration with the full name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed social media to only selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as an" "" "organizer of information dissemination" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to take responsibility for removing content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and OdnoClassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedia's Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data sent to Turkey support the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was closed because it became" "" "an information source that cooperates with groups in order to make a political defamation campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is therefore, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop having sniffed</seg>
<seg id="2968">This week, the United Kingdom government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecom operators and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation runs until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>

<seg id="2976">This entry was written by Catherine Lai and was originally published on 15 June 2016 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="2977">The following version has been published as part of a partnership agreement on Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2978">The LGBTQ community in China showed their solidarity with the victims of the massacre at night club Pulse in Orlando, Florida, where 49 people died on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Adam's, a gay bar in Beijing, held a vigil on Tuesday, June 14, a vigil for the victims.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Mondo Wong, the owner of Adam's, said to the Hong Kong Free Press, that he wanted to do something for Orlando:</seg>
<seg id="2981">My heart broke when I saw the news.</seg>
<seg id="2982">We want to use the Internet, the media and other channels to let them know that they are not alone.</seg>

<seg id="2986">"so many friends came and showed their love," he wrote on Wednesday morning on the news platform WeChat.</seg>

<seg id="2990">On Monday, around 190 LGBTQ organizations signed a joint statement on the massacre in China.</seg>
<seg id="2991">It is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2992">Picture uploaded on Blued. via Blued's Weibo.</seg>
<seg id="2993">We, the members of the LGBTQ community, stand side by side with the victims of the tragedy and their families and loved ones and with all members of the worldwide LGBTQ community.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We mourn together with them for the loss of so many innocent lives and condemn terrorism as well as all other forms of violence perpetrated towards people due to their sexuality, gender identity and expression of gender. in China violence comes to "cure" violence based on sexuality, gender identity and expression of sex, for example by harassment of LGBTQ teenagers in schools, generally discriminatory treatment and in the application of therapies with the aim of "healing" gay and bisexual people.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Blued, China's most popular dating app for homosexuals, changed her screen, which now displays the "we stand with Orlando" (about: page alongside Orlando).</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the LGBT community is part of the great family of humanity.</seg>
