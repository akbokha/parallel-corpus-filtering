that is James Ris@@ en .
perhaps you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that N@@ SA heard illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should give a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally delivered dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has identified Ris@@ en and called on him to call his supposed sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the first constitutional review , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had for years , that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can always hide themselves less .
instead of separating and spl@@ itting it , it could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without their consent , hid his telephone records secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit card , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA whist@@ leb@@ lower and crack @-@ supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communications software that has not yet been written when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site such as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information priv@@ ily , and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology specialists such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility of wrong@@ doing . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the nearest environment worker who is alert to the poll@@ uted waters of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street in@@ sider who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest Daten@@ l@@ eck of history was published . &#93; &#91; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and susp@@ icious &#93; &#91; vast sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to give an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by News about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of USD 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of child days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next documents revealed .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be weeping from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ z@@ kap@@ u .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it interesting that in the USA there are less reports about this matter .
presumably because there has been no prominent American ever seen in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data tangle from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. states , less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investigation into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African Minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all except one lawyer our investig@@ ator made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wound up in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that may sound very glo@@ omy as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been collecting in central registers on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama expos@@ ures , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which is now making this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a ticket sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ er , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh dear ! what did I get involved ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild alien sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sli@@ pping on to@@ e tips to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my angle of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , nearly broke , my room@@ mate puts out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and so called &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely differently because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ek@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are looking at things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we were striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your un@@ locked mobile phone with your left sitting neighbour .
this silent touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he came from , how would his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you had 150 ratings , which all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
this is because a well thought @-@ out feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to disp@@ ense with negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had issued their ratings , before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by judgments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation em@@ its com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re told too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great artwork in your home ! I &apos;m going on vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can it be done with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text@@ box to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put aside these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been met before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when faith was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction .
for people have the right to trust each other .
if trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who rescue life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can only recommend it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work with money transactions ?
it is a question of economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would be more than looking for a thorough re@@ plen@@ ishing and showing a neighborhood that you haven &apos;t heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already started .
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . today , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think this is amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know of course that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had such a big impact , I wonder what we could use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a g@@ ull @-@ like fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , and compared to the pressure I as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , asked question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later , I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking down &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should one do something like this ?
I changed the channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern ancest@@ ry ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; atom@@ ized Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only did my country be attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start studying .
I remember how I heard me -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard , and read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations who said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Be careful not . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I watched the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims in the open and beat them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly assert itself .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the US .
it &apos;s just the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the US but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , par@@ ame@@ dic@@ s and Olympic Games .
is the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
it might keep a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to toler@@ ant people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radic@@ alisation process , one has noticed that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one thro@@ ws a look at her , she does not drive what she read in her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , put her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to find a solution .
this Ima@@ m re@@ fut@@ ed the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept in mind to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when test persons submit messages reported negative about Muslims , they rather voice military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when al@@ loc@@ ating collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother such a young man become an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after her visit to Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had had courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims all over the world , and I did so with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception tend to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a multi @-@ billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ ets reached our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting to each other , flying units achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ able structures .
they have learned to carry burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possibility in an autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , to determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind @-@ bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter what location the flight device achieves the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract issues that penetrate to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled air@@ crafts , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is a lot happening inside the interior , so that it can fly steady and move anywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the likel@@ ihood of just throwing it right when everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in car@@ el@@ essness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ pitch prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if it is restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic scar@@ let heat .
the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units offers a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the extra secure machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us lies the reward in the development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns converted into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in a timely manner .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was born on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which arise approximately through colli@@ ding black holes .
most people considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the perception performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes cleared through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my to@@ dd@@ ler father .
basically this was the fruit of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes and their by observ@@ atories as Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ utter in the structure of space and time .
when over@@ drawing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pun@@ ched into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked whilst hitting the waves . el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by 1 . this is why the Lig@@ o employees declared ins@@ ane .
with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of killing , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by listening to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been occupied for quite a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date at least I &apos;ll never forget -- listened to the following : &#91; Sur@@ render device usch &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to listen to , this recognizes as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate approximately as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us think briefly what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle around one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and listen to the un@@ seen .
much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot from them about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through this op@@ a@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o sees them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the suction cups for our archaeological work , so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear to stop talking my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I talk to myself to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very embarrass@@ ed .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think of things , make you think about life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I make TV , in great style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , ie all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs I have created myself , and not just produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is still doing this ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a class room , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just lying around on the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all the blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
so as to get a high sound , I run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clinical and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum .
there is such a change in me when work is doing well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on it .
many people assume that when I declare to them the sum , I &apos;m talking about writing that writing is a joy to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the sum -- when I began with television production when I began working and working and making , creating , creating and working together , I discovered that thing , this sum , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . summ@@ ing is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , you won &apos;t be able to strive for size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ ming .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more things the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their M@@ om is a single work title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my M@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ y , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als ceased .
the mo@@ m of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was out .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not asleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there were no sums .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum was me .
so what can you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re a teacher , a bank@@ ers , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the bu@@ zz@@ ing when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses a question to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on my way out late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no one more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my sums are smo@@ other , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically out of the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the bu@@ zz , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet sounds , delicate vocals , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum , the working environment , the titanium sum , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum depends on love .
the sum is the flow that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real tot@@ em ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sum is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t like to play the way I work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what is better for a person than being at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we run around in the garden , back and forth , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it as well !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit is replaced by me .
and my teen@@ age daughter talks to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it .
everybody can take 15 minutes on a piece , even at a bad day !
15 minutes a play !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
I am not perfect in it . I will fail and I will win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes in a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my Sum@@ ming .
the Sum@@ m@@ ary of Life .
the Sum@@ m@@ ary of Love .
the sum of my work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s up to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan Poker playing to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life is wide in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think of things , I &apos;ll stir you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you nice .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the best known ones , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffer from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in the case of skull @-@ brain trauma the brain is un@@ willing and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to make cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , im@@ mature cells .
you might know from the biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our brain rin@@ se cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they left for us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential source of cell that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic sphere and then practice the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we have re @-@ inv@@ ali@@ dated them at the t@@ apping point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ launch these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what happens when we re @-@ launch the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ inv@@ aded the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made an injury and they re @-@ inv@@ ali@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ inv@@ aded .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we coloured in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they did that very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand any more .
just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we were re @-@ establishing the cells : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ur@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use them .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in man .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I am sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my che@@ es@@ y friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a genuine democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro Group succ@@ um@@ bed to an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies will m@@ ess our future and wa@@ ver our great new technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of extravag@@ ance I would like to inform you about an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit @-@ parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt @-@ mountain ,
but few know his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of unused cash , which is one of the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who , however , are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and produce income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and have absolutely nothing to do except to infl@@ ame the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops , which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , out of fear , the proph@@ eci@@ es of the ear could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
its very wast@@ eful way . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the saving of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , ali@@ ens , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it gave them the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ting in matters of the public che@@ ek .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while economy -- the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two began , by gradually sub@@ stit@@ uting politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my dis@@ cord with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ate the animals they feed on , so that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ assed policy so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ inflic@@ ted economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , the economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the toil@@ ing poor could recover only through a miracle a position like in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and social conflicts deeper , just as it comes -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we have to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and to ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease @-@ controlled hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or by something that resembles the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are in the study of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; indul@@ ging in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it take to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all the revenues come from capital and out of revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency backed by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that there was not the technical means at that time .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which it fav@@ ours privileged persons , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it more democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I can say this so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to unite liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China now resembles much of the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century even sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continual den@@ ial that a massive fault line ran through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ounce den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the financi@@ ers &apos; sites to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be even pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is faced by someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union .
this will have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price hasn &apos;t heard the most yet , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes back to the decision that Roy just met three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an hed@@ geho@@ g hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy doesn &apos;t have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after you looked for a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to for@@ bid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium size , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use them .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode each of these shows and makes them online where everyone can watch them for free .
and when Amazon yields things in vain , does one intervene , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when to start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or look at again .
they collect millions of data to decide on which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many people don &apos;t remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve amounts to 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course there is the question : what is happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed firms .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow means that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so , this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also incorrect .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that by analyzing data analytics break@@ outs of flu , the worst kind , they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderful and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly worked no more ,
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows increasingly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do , but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they made a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did so in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas then they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No key , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will discuss it later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with a little bit wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
