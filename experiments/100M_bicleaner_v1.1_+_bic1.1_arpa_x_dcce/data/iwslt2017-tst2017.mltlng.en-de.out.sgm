<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA heard illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should give a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally delivered drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has identified Risen and called on him to call his supposed sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional review, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had for years, that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and splitting it, it could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without their consent, hid his telephone records secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit card, and even travel links with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA whistleblower and crack-supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his attempt to protect whistleblowers, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of whistleblowers going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communications software that has not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information privily, and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology specialists such as Edward Snowden have the possibility of wrongdoing. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the nearest environment worker who is alert to the polluted waters of Flint. or a wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest Datenleck of history was published.] [Panama Papers "revealed that rich and suspicious] [vast sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to give an explanation.] This week we were asked by News about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of USD 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of child days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next documents revealed.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be weeping from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryozkapu.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the USA there are less reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there has been no prominent American ever seen in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle after which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data tangle from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. states, less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigation into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African Minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States in order to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one lawyer our investigator made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, wound up in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very gloomy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been collecting in central registers on a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama exposures, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which is now making this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a ticket sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Deer, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh dear! what did I get involved?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, slipping on toe tips to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my angle of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, nearly broke, my roommate puts out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and so called "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure that our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely differently because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleekczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are looking at things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your unlocked mobile phone with your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who now has Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he came from, how would his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 ratings, which all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">This is because a well thought-out feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to dispense with negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had issued their ratings, before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation emits commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you're told too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you can tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request will not be accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "Great artwork in your home! I'm going on vacation with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can it be done with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the textbox to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put aside these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when faith was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have the right to trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who rescue life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">"" "I can only recommend it!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a question of economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would be more than looking for a thorough replenishing and showing a neighborhood that you haven't heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already started.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children were moved out. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. today, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think this is amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had such a big impact, I wonder what we could use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>

<seg id="325">You know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>

<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are the inventors and teachers, paramedics and Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="330">Is the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might keep a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to tolerant people of other faiths and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalisation process, one has noticed that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "holy book."</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, put her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised to find a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam refuted the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept in mind to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when test persons submit messages reported negative about Muslims, they rather voice military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims' rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood swelled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>

<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>

<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a multi-billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packets reached our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting to each other, flying units achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-reliable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possibility in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, to determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and thus has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind-bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that no matter what location the flight device achieves the optimum position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract issues that penetrate to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircrafts, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying is working with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is a lot happening inside the interior, so that it can fly steady and move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of just throwing it right when everyone is watching is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-pitch propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if it is restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic scarlet heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The extra secure machine over there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us lies the reward in the development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns converted into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit more brightly than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was born on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer-gravitational-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved the perception performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes cleared through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my toddler father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically this was the fruit of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their by observatories as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clutter in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When overdrawing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and punched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked whilst hitting the waves. elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by 1. this is why the Ligo employees declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Mr Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of killing, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice talks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by listening to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been occupied for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date at least I'll never forget -- listened to the following: [Surrender device usch] Someone who knows what to listen to, this recognizes as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which rotate approximately as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and listen to the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super nova, for example. I would like to know why masserole stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot from them about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through this opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo sees them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the suction cups for our archaeological work, so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a completely new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say," "" "Yes," "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to stop talking my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>

<seg id="572">"" "she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the Beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I talk to myself to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "Yes" "" "to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think of things, make you think about life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days at four shows, ie all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs I have created myself, and not just produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a country or a class room, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so you understand that I'm not just lying around on the computer and fancier, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all the blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as to get a high sound, I run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is doing well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I declare to them the sum, I'm talking about writing that writing is a joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sum -- when I began with television production when I began working and working and making, creating, creating and working together, I discovered that thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. summing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, you won't be able to strive for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more things the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their Mom is a single work title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my Mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitty, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The mom of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a titanium is not asleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there were no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what can you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "howl, stupid author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're working, you're a teacher, a bankers, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the buzzing when you know the buzzing when the buzz is stopped, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern waitress" "" "poses a question to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on my way out late and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no one more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my sums are smoother, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically out of the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the buzz, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet sounds, delicate vocals, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sum, the working environment, the titanium sum, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with broadcasts and TV hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the flow that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real totem ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't like to play the way I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what is better for a person than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We run around in the garden, back and forth, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it as well!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit is replaced by me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenage daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can take 15 minutes on a piece, even at a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a play!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totals, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>

<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more.</seg>

<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known ones, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffer from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in the case of skull-brain trauma the brain is unwilling and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to make cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You might know from the biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our brain rinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential source of cell that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic sphere and then practice the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we have re-invalidated them at the tapping point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-launch these cells into normal brain tissue? and what happens when we re-launch the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-invaded the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made an injury and they re-invaliated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-invaded.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we coloured in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we were re-establishing the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>

<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "indeed, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my cheesy friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Euro Group succumbed to an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies will mess our future and waver our great new technologies." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of extravagance I would like to inform you about an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-summit-paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt-mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of the wealthy depositors and corporations, who, however, are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and produce income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and have absolutely nothing to do except to inflame the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin-tops, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that advocates the pessimism of investors, which, out of fear, the prophecies of the ear could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its very wasteful way. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the saving of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the athenical democracy was and is that it gave them the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in matters of the public cheek.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very bright, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while economy -- the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two began, by gradually substituting politics and disempowering them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power, because the power is migrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my discord with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators that sustainably decimate the animals they feed on, so that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harassed policy so far that it hurts itself through the self-inflicted economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being exploited, the economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the toiling poor could recover only through a miracle a position like in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of sublime, and social conflicts deeper, just as it comes -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and to ensure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a disease-controlled hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," or by something that resembles the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are in the study of the universe, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athenians "Agora," indulging in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it take to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all the revenues come from capital and out of revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency backed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that there was not the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberally, in which it favours privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it more democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers described as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I can say this so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to unite liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China now resembles much of the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century even smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to self-complacency, and the continual denial that a massive fault line ran through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>

<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to denounce denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>

<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">"" "" "" "this goes back to the decision that Roy just met three years ago." ""</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an hedgehog hairstyle and describes herself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy doesn't have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after you looked for a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price doesn't care about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium size, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't enthuse them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode each of these shows and makes them online where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon yields things in vain, does one intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when to start the show, when you pause, which parts you skips or look at again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide on which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this reads:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that many people don't remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve amounts to 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course there is the question: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow means that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so, this is a bit frightening because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">This is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies is also incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that by analyzing data analytics breakouts of flu, the worst kind, they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderful and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly worked no more,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows increasingly into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do, but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they made a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did so in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas then they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No key, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will discuss it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with a little bit wiser than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
