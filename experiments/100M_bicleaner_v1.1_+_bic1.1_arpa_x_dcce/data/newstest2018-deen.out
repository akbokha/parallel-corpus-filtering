Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former land of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but very informative .
especially if you compare them to current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering tap@@ estry , which you cannot recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , detailed maps , so @-@ called primitive documents , were incorporated into the cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying authorities between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally pulling off with the Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace of 9 February 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide campaign of Bavaria .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph made the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying authorities .
the documentary collection for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was registered 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a district of Munich .
today there is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ination &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots are no longer evidence of farmers , but farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 was the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was indeed a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other hand of Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was born . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and for example ended the gre@@ asing of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the prison .
for 280 patients there was first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k r@@ ren@@ te in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital in Munich @-@ Ost , Germany , has been one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people from the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east is located to the west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in architec@@ turally reminiscent of the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ ia , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger Street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a large remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn root route .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich @-@ Map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Committee published travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to Pro@@ mot@@ ing Far@@ ms has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , demands af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention to travel through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents happen in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the statement of the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement authorities , which dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , set out the group to release the warning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights which happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are held because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group quoted cases like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in du@@ bi@@ ous circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline at all while traveling through the state and taken custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in which black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are considered to be 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to take deposits or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classified the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
the travel warnings are also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
the fence project is elementary
the Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided an image on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ town association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Bru@@ de@@ mann family grav@@ eyard .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his operation , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ eti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing way for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ar@@ ist only Regi@@ on@@ ales come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot manage such steep areas prof@@ itably .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much needs to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental plant and cultivated it without any chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser even if it does not lead to bio@@ activity .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the advancement of leaders . &quot;
with a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of their support
in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced off by eleven participants .
thus , the open @-@ wing surface is 40 hectares not allowed to be explored until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of € 71 500 was funded by the local leader , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Peter Weiss , too , stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape conservation line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state subsi@@ dy of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the presence of a conveying background recorded by L@@ PR is a prerequisite .
moreover , the fence must not be tractor @-@ bearing ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation .
for the 2009 Fis@@ cal Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open @-@ plan surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp Regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took its importance , and in particular the meaning it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the stir@@ ring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your f@@ ain@@ es , your poor , and your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ up classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty calls no one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not be lit for the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh is encountered here on something .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense that seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle appeals to a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ eau - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her speech speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ dan made quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , competing in their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir goes along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1.500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle appeals to her first world champion@@ ships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being special about team captains is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the voters &apos; home
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was su@@ cking him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a reci@@ pro@@ cal action with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary head of heat .
he has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - is a public forum , which is officially designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ gans spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse advoc@@ ated the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not value this idea , if a number of people occupies the same issue , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what marked the governor &apos;s staff as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook @-@ era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ t@@ orials or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters put on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his point of view of the Am@@ ity treaty , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and real leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he settled this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player headquartered in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on homeland .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; said the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as a lot is concealed in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which continuously im@@ pe@@ des the construction works , represents a big problem for the building group of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts against red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relates Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ ment in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red no@@ dule is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 p.m. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was adopted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raising in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , the independent part of Papua New Guinea imported the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desolate . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences and corrugated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an of Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone Free@@ port valued 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua with wood resources has valued 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid close to USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 to a single officer .
pap@@ al demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 acres have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide according to the Asia @-@ human rights commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reject all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have intensified because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are struggling to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have started to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it cost the native Papua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his electoral campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter assured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ o &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ri@@ f@@ le bul@@ lets , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua people , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial arch@@ ways and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - running in the circle and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began hur@@ ting stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document by TI@@ ME , which was not released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ amed does not know who has fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station only because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to attack the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be gone through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then she took a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; United Nations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which the UN has accused of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence agreement , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ m dul@@ l@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police ra@@ ced on vill@@ agers in the neighbourhood of the Dei@@ y@@ ai neighborhood .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers who responded by firing off warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house two days ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police force from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ inous company for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal members , Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the Free Papua @-@ Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people of Papua New Guinea , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai clan .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permit for filming was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign were not realized by the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ paper@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alleg@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him . &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but wishes to remain anonymous .
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019 , but Papua will say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the head of the tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ ai know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he must pay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims led to a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body &apos;s bodies were buried in an area just across the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place in one of Dubai &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , which in only two years swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise , which one coinci@@ dentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name to be George , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units cleared the fire at 4 : 00 p.m. local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for isolation and facing on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup individual only on two winning sets was not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority for this sport .
the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classic remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ ce missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our Member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
it wasn &apos;t until the vote that the proposal came after many obj@@ ections to put the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists will be the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers get banned objects in the airplane , find out a survey
a survey among passengers indicated that more than 20 percent of deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously forbidden items were smu@@ g@@ gled over the US Transportation Security Administration &apos;s control points , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been late discovered that they had mis@@ er@@ ably traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . - also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they had know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were intentionally tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to know@@ ingly having carried items with blades by security screening , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately banned banned drugs in the plane .
the company said it had consul@@ ted travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dently caused smu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security and how many would have done it deliberately .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the safety , those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ trade ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased to announce the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the continuously trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more giant sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k first revealed another , less brilliant figure for the first time in announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k often had adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose delivery just commen@@ ces .
now Mus@@ k says : 6@@ 3,000 of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding booking .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the USA 1000 USD and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , sp@@ aci@@ al mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be put together - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines without any major disrup@@ tions at maximum capacity .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , then the dis@@ connection of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flocks .
EPA Princip@@ al P@@ ru@@ itt reg@@ ains itself because of the lowering of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after he was acc@@ using from 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama @-@ era rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state &apos;s environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline expi@@ red on October 1st for states to comply with the 2015 standards for O@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing in local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma At@@ tor@@ ney General before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly re@@ acted to block or delay regulating the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ iser Reg@@ ational roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA Administr@@ ator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards is quite simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to adhere to deadlines for execution and then to be accused of being accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to establish an appointment for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial procedures , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of the EPA stated that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available power &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil O@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
public health officials and environ@@ ment@@ alists were che@@ ering on P@@ ru@@ ffe &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this sensible step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Divers@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to respect environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ult celebrates 750 years of the Church of St. Hil@@ arius
750 years of the Church of St. Hil@@ arius : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lingen is invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ sem@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ bey &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the deed of the document , apart from the former parish church , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the Church or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age and not vice versa .
so people also lived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ober@@ st@@ ale Freuden@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dating from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the third , the splendid village of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 are subject to historical conditions .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this church .
associated with this was the right to use a parish priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two fell apart at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church mill and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ bl@@ lingen University C@@ emetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s 8 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half of it fell .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower which still exists today remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ bach and Rolf @-@ Dieter V@@ asi@@ em are the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organizers , friends and supporters invite tum@@ ours on Sunday 16th July , to the Six@@ th Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission starts at 3 : 30 p.m .
to finish the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the Gra@@ vey@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is important for tum@@ ours and listeners .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association requests Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen I only existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ gregation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council has once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines to be legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it an occasion to re@@ examine the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heimer Slot .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was hurt mort@@ ally .
two more people were slightly injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to take advantage of this weekend on September 8th and 9th , in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping tour in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to which offers hold their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite you to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the Municip@@ ality and Industry Association co@@ operates with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the well @-@ booked Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to make them active .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , potential buyers should be re@@ opened again or again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost sight of the inner city while shopping .
in the end , all would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that spread partly , King said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen informed that five Thür@@ inger cities are taking part in the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local commerce and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her own purchasing behaviour .

as a matter of fact , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline .
at the time of the holiday there were only a few people in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
Tru@@ mp made after en@@ rol@@ le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of phone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp urged the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president appe@@ ased him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ or to make Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp , Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would let him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after saying Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaig@@ ners lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man bro@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am torn the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience clas@@ hed with very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens are back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been las@@ hed by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody ever was indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly incredible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a lifetime citizen .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to finish , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician att@@ aches a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot@@ ing for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice to the black citizens in Georgia made it possible for the first time to vote their vote for the election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com claimed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and when you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra &apos;s Gre@@ ene has managed the annual re@@ position of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descrip@@ tive , gri@@ pping and based in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching , because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to go back to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ ren Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ un , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ ams and presses him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ he , wa@@ il from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona ret@@ ells the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely here the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then still@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a grief is above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and manages Bil@@ lie holidays mour@@ ning pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as overwhelming moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the ly@@ n@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ pers each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he would remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ un embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta suggests about the night @-@ position with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski has fought to find words that have left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks keeps yard at his table , eating and remin@@ ding citizens &apos; rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ appointment is in some way inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ st@@ ori@@ ed setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine po@@ ets pose as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which runs through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they mis@@ lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , d@@ ashed a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the glori@@ ously nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy wei@@ ght@@ box .
brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated , who humble himself and bent his hands towards Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in casual casual wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ellen@@ istic whist@@ ling concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great jubil@@ ations in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls were going down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to have rejo@@ iced over this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
in their volunteer year they work equally in several places .
where to go anywhere ?
quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur ( S@@ LC ) .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different bet@@ ting places during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can do it from the retirement home to the youth work - in all sorts of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ no@@ d@@ care .
for me this was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from Civil Engineering ?
amount : well clear , here it is not about calculating st@@ atics .
there are always other people in the head , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
amount : for that I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s the way life is .
Pear@@ son cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend in order to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce additional 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced .
the job cuts , the Director General John Fall@@ on , for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 announced in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in a third cost @-@ cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the swift step towards digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , said officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , declared a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening is said to be a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carried away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised guer@@ ri@@ lla movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the UN , there was at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide thri@@ ller killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of US forces supporting the military and the police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the tu@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states compl@@ ained the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA formally announced its decision on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oz@@ on@@ ate provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and because we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone provisions in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to meet stric@@ ter air@@ quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rec@@ laim a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that will boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature reserves to worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common hall wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ i@@ os winds up the establishment of a community space in the future residential complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the area in the parish is still part of the community , it will not be possible until now , but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are in fact ho@@ vering not to fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision taken by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget will be decided by funding opportunities already last autumn .
the building is located in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the establishment of a community space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 per cent .
the proposal is to indicate to the investor that in this respect one does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both saddle and pitch roof - as well as the pitch roof - would be possible to reduce the pile height and make the building more economical - we would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried sole means this additive .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings that you don &apos;t get ahead with , but now you can rest in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
she sees behind that a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface , there is no subsi@@ dy , but gives a real exchange value in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ man &apos;s request to acc@@ use the proposal is three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we make the decision so , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : cycli@@ st is thrown onto the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured .
as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road along the road along the road to the Schwar@@ zer Weg in direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
he granted him priority in the same direction traveling passenger car driver .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting car .
FC Bayern Munich must do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba will have to leave the game against Dortmund .
FC Bayern will travel with staff to the first mandatory game of the new season to Dortmund .
seven professionals lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the staff at the German soccer record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed on Friday .
in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ ern Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti created the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights casts a spell over the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) distributed on Friday .
in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
there is a planet path in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confron@@ ts the information needs of many visitors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it unites nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets is to be supplemented by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star brigh@@ ter than another , although it could be considerably far@@ ther away .
it is also taught in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to be seen .
the association runs since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest situated observ@@ atory of Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the plant in the middle of the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , the Planet@@ arium Göttingen has been supplying something similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ g - the Planet@@ en@@ weg .
starting before Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads with its stel@@ es up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of equals ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae on the individual planets - including the dem@@ oted Plu@@ to at the end@@ point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters distance measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation super @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ oning world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair of photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas re@@ marked that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former body weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it was to be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree on a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell , after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later pushed out to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko insist@@ ed with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side is looking very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured by tire plat@@ ter
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control over his vehicle shortly before the junction in the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of North for about an hour , followed by the traffic on the left road@@ side at the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ises the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , too , wouldn &apos;t the two opponents have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ers too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ erk@@ ette is to be further optimized .
and a fool after an offen@@ se wants to catch the For@@ tun@@ an even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be the case that no one puts himself on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the tri@@ angles than with the four @-@ se@@ ater .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just been in the tri@@ erk@@ ette on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t make so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a ti@@ dy season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight play@@ grounds , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 per cent where they are currently , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland become an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , just because we claim to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is very positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s boss coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application assessment published
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started out the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Office ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees that were minor .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person being examined is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they were usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
evaluating the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Public Affairs and Transport in the District of the District of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three renov@@ ations in need between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction date is scheduled for October and Light is sure that the schedule is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fixing that is also used as an operating system .
on the south side of the bridge , a bridge cap of 2.@@ 20 metres should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about this is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges .
special flair of the fingers has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fiber cable that many companies are connected to .
local residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the building @-@ yard @-@ building and the collection @-@ pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated lane @-@ lane by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher location , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three anch@@ ors amount to 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
it is not so common that parties pull on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the &quot; Krei@@ stag &quot; volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that will flag peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D members , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; on the well , but now takes place on the parking lot underneath the R@@ ond@@ ola - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A world and one of the leading organisers , is really looking forward to : &quot; it &apos;s great how many people here come together . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also easily eat the Af@@ D , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ mes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he has made an effort to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ á@@ m there were not enough parking places available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ me is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Federal Republic of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can remove - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf B@@ tro@@ mb@@ one tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli are solo trump@@ ets of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz ech@@ o@@ er N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating synthesis of the arts .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it specially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart fully talked about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I have been . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and sincer@@ ely believed in du@@ alism .
it never interfer@@ ed with or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but at school time , when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt offen@@ ded , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not love her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp had previously announced a big announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal store by his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country look great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , in@@ decisive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an apparent excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ ine said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were awarded gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e , the re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ engage Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funeral ceremony for soldiers in Mali &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a funeral service in the North Hessen F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
for an un@@ explained crash , Defense Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ onation of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old chief of staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral took place in the circle of the family , close friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ eker .
gri@@ ev@@ ous ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arms at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sh@@ attered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the Figh@@ ting helicopter Tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of its regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ak@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , belonging to the soldiers , said : &quot; if this occupation did not turn away the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show that the Le@@ yen said that the deployment would be dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was what the Royal House shared on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the queen would agree with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have been king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Communion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - not after his death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by declared , the head @-@ speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swift re@@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dis@@ integration of the parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties from their parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ests established her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U Group leader Björn A@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regulatory on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l thinks it is indispensable that the parliament resol@@ ves his self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag will withdraw the trust and elect a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be examined in a legally clean way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ NP &apos;s step &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the rebel@@ li@@ ous de@@ pu@@ ties to return their parliament &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they have reg@@ ained their state mandate , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to run any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substantial differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ stepping of the Dutch Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ests to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country day .
the exit T@@ NP costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her hurt vanity and fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony with@@ stands this dirty intri@@ gue game and attempts to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U Group leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to add El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career presents .
the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from po@@ ison@@ ous eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp on the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier isn &apos;t really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately turned off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same way as manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are suscep@@ tible to traffic and are harmless to health .
if the limit maximum content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , they are not suscep@@ tible to traffic .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to current state of knowledge , the production enterprises are not directly responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , due to alleged illegal practices of service companies , they must expect economic damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there is too little control in the event of a serious incident .
is there a lack of personnel , or in the case of conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
however , the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out as 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases in which crimes can exist are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm algorithm necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to use only safe and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an unauthorized insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly app@@ alled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the counter@@ fei@@ ted means are manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ to @-@ supply animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the Financial Rules of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization controlling the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G had to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign it and bring it to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they have to deal with legitimate sources of income , which allow them to break even the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , which had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year lease period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor , Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the proceeds will be posted for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it has been arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that could try to out@@ source their financial supervision by bl@@ aming their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing exceeds the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ing was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come through payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar will be a World Cup ambassador and a great manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will still be more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ manager Ar@@ sene Lup@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because one can approach different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation comes before a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white s@@ lic@@ ed bil@@ l@@ boards of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing on the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a car manufacturer .
the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y the number of applicants with the new tender .
but only Swiss producers come into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the treaty in the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ d , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not able to reach an opinion .
Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss made a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
two and a half years ago Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo , with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline is co@@ operating with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of First Class with goo@@ dies are spoiled by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nasty passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi distri@@ butes chocolate from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repetition of history is simultaneously no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael showed the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by getting stiff at the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are adults now , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ ody leaves more after the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cri@@ es the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character falls through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another ins@@ ane @-@ evil plot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s lip @-@ beard by &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental del@@ u@@ sions that could hei@@ gh@@ ten this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon commemor@@ ates another kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his east @-@ to @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka pays homage to a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ ing Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV how Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides for an ongoing game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the ver@@ acity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who we@@ ars a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to beat a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office told Kon@@ stanz on Friday .
15 defend@@ ants were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials discovered large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
German arrest warran@@ ts were issued against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators took part in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Maf@@ ia is accused of organised crime , heavy acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ stanz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been investigating organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the public prosec@@ utor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore the big effort was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
ways lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner registry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner registry has considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the registered data could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in cases of asylum procedures and deportation , in a way that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the estimates , ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered in the Register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by some 600 Aus@@ länder@@ behörde in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , the quality of data in parts has not been well done so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can slow down processes significantly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to leave at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false classi@@ fications were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age if they have entered it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in paper it is said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to substanti@@ ate the ministry , the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send back refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing survey in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights recording conditions due to short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach were already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
all ahead of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his now 100 donations , has now given 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , nor self @-@ serving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for the cann@@ ed foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher wrote about the actions performed in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Circle Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry t@@ amed to the multiple donated donated blood donations .

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have mut@@ ed spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while maintaining interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but they sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest rate increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation imposed by the Bre@@ x@@ it , and it said that the credit cost would probably have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February , although it is said now that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to de@@ strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rates of interest , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphasized that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the downward corrected growth forecast for the Bank for this and next year will be compared to the 1.9 % forecast projected in May and 1.7 % .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 USD and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision for no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened increasing expectations of interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for budgets that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening will become even worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year prog@@ nosis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the collapse of the pound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for a rate of interest increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed budgets , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said this was expected and will be tigh@@ tened again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributed to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , since the credi@@ tors are sil@@ ently looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages take out , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a high court fight against funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ surgery pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the Health Service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .
pre@@ position pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission for infections at risk of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as used on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted to needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England in order to develop a new instrument which is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Minister of Sh@@ adows Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that they contribute to the closure of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living big life : mezzanine and clever designer che@@ ats have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne patio - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet have been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally an one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne Storage and an mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which could be found .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to b@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage ser@@ ine mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cut@@ lery and j@@ ars from Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan explains of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposite , so when you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch you and which can help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of something standard into something amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a conflict of one of the biggest real estate agents of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp analysis of the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers possess 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family called West@@ co jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of justice states that this means that Col@@ in property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reviews proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for the control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an early &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the argument . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both sides .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk @-@ bars and delic@@ acy businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970 &apos;s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pay her property to her sons gra@@ ci@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very cau@@ tious although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to pass our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the pres@@ idency of the President .
others tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO says that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg compared to Poli@@ tico in February . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter is under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials there is to ensure that his personal consumption includes a steady pra@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter is ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets would not contain any more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp didn &apos;t send .
if his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts were worth it .
but nobody has consequently been able to prevent Tru@@ mp from producing controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about advis@@ ing the advis@@ ers to bring forward du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it dar@@ es to figure out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp was reading the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , get the Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kel@@ ly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped for .
the police all over Europe sends post cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
as the addresses of the heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience showed that many fle@@ eting hide themselves at holiday destinations was the name of Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ent@@ to has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online hym@@ ns could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a tren@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands again stand with some determined travellers on the war foot , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were ki@@ cked out in May , without having been deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ imped@@ ed to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous visitor said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travelers stayed there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birmingham &apos;s Council knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last lap of those travelers to be pl@@ under@@ ed only by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to make them move as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birken@@ hof to become the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is built from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
with the closure of the Birken@@ hof hotel by the then Ambi@@ ance Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , around 30,000 nights per year were lost at the time and also income from the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming into the administrative district , the hotel building was offered to the County Council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the estate of Freuden@@ stadt .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will be called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Birken@@ hof , the building sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are done .
the floors were pulled out , partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ arranged , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in the Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level city level , Sch@@ erer under@@ lines .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ vers .
the no@@ tions of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly what he wants .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external plants are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee included work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on familiar subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper showed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N station reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a long time to deliberately interfer@@ ed in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focuses on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also examined more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that the special investig@@ ator Tru@@ mp came to the centre in person and searched for the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Y@@ uries is to check the present evidence in possible bre@@ aches of crime and decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called anchor clips .
most of the time it is switched on when it is a matter of larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to the court under oath .
according to CN@@ N , there have already been inv@@ itations that revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who were involved in the meeting were called on to a statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. Tru@@ mp@@ s were also consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and Paul Man@@ a@@ fort his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller would not be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the charging of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that ha@@ st@@ ened the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
there is no reason to believe that something has changed , so it was stated in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ aring repro@@ aches have been loud against Tru@@ mp , he &apos;s trying to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
comm@@ as testified before a Senate Committee in June , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and its staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on the insist@@ ence of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday after which the special promot@@ er could not be released so easily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg , of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin , has loos@@ ened from the shelf .
this was what the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs about 1 tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now moving north@@ ward and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gar@@ gan@@ ts that have registered researchers over the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
according to the research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the ic@@ e@@ berg .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ et background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was up to now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us .
Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this cow@@ ard@@ stick the balance of growth and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago .
a complete cow@@ ardi@@ ce is broken down there , writes A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I am talking about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ cow@@ ardi@@ s are also in danger , because the front edge has never been as far removed as at present .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key .
melt melt and ice @-@ berg do not increase the sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it follows after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaci@@ ers flowing directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a lesser extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth largest shelf of Antar@@ c@@ tica after A@@ WI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and that we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not trace the outbreak of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many c@@ ud@@ d@@ ules of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collap@@ sed in recent decades .
this long skir@@ t of the Antar@@ ctic stre@@ ches towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the last 50 years and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to help house @-@ ari@@ f personnel
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employer &apos;s association in order to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the round of the chal@@ k @-@ day saw 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and cler@@ ks work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees now have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very desired .
around 6@@ 20 applications were posted for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as powers of general administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the application scar@@ city in a future @-@ oriented manner .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and the outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
thus , high time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had long been worried about a great surprise in the chal@@ k @-@ day , when he publicly challenged personnel costs and amaz@@ es the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ related towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards years of work .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis caution came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat from the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which was in operation only a year ago , refused to comment on the alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor , Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew will take infl@@ atable immigrants aboard , which are delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor &apos;s Act , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of being over@@ ruled by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have in particular an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential amendments or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy in the wake of the rescue operations in recent weeks has greatly reduced the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner outer post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , for four days to enjoy Trieste and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between , there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely long climbs for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , a viewpoint on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were told again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ lets brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
even Neustadt was driven .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - spor@@ tive and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga gear up for E @-@ sport
in the future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also recognized the first feder@@ ates who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that a number of clubs are rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the World Cup FIFA World Cup in London will host the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London next weekend , where the g@@ amer of different clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , in particular , that young people will go to the stadium even in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be far more often present on these markets online than to send the Swiss approval to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
during e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA soccer simulation will be cont@@ ested on a competition level .
long ago , as in normal sports , le@@ agues have become established in which the professionals compete against each other .
and by 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is surely getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , including increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
the players are on the road internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years turnover is expected to lie at 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte counsel@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participated in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competitions .
there is a lot happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany lag@@ s behind in comparison to Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board chairman R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to fall into no@@ stal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football stays like it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy op@@ press for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls for suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she did not take responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pursue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge others to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy found dead from a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang on , get out of a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn the generator down and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking for attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit by some press from the fall .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ mich took me as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern scores a big season for the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not detri@@ mental .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ ich immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made his tie at his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first application as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entrance could have been better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could be interpreted by Kim@@ i .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had just been born out of the holidays , but he was chosen as a leader .
sugar@@ s are most often distributed to those of whom you have a lot of confidence that you want to keep in mind .
those who have been chosen to approach Lah@@ m &apos;s heritage can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ ich confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was running as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest .
and at all Kim@@ ich worked in this starting formation as the one who can take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with themselves .
V@@ idal therefore , to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly fold ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to get involved in the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( fold also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le won &apos;t drop neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot .
after all , it worked out quite well .
Sü@@ le ran right beside Kim@@ mich , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the nam@@ or@@ ily occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often heavy , and Sü@@ le tried to win a few times in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not how we hoped it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also brought up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw following the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ich said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cris@@ p statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what goes on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you simply have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new ones any more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak at T V @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the desires of the economy , which has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest turn@@ around sees nat@@ u in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 is expected to be building law .
the West Bank also plays a role in the country &apos;s plans , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Traffic Plan .
the goal is to start the course in December 2020 , says ministry spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ u sees it as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label , like Wis@@ sing , to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that collap@@ ses for ten years .
furthermore , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company pra@@ ises the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier has an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros , when graduates take their own degree independently within ten years .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to create facts , at the same time lacking the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
so far , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to hire Wis@@ sing in the state company mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 , less in the receipt of country roads than suggested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supplies in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a grade 3.3 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of directors of the wind power company Pro Wind .
in April , the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of in@@ consist@@ encies she cleared the field again .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a re@@ vocation .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers , systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases expelled from diesel vehicles , also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rej@@ ecting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but return on normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated in the United States was expanded .
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer adds a dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
thus also the Is@@ ar @-@ visitors take part , a raft through Munich on the mor@@ row Saturday , which has a special message .
if it hits the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the construction refer@@ at wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be sharpen@@ ed as a protected wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and actions to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll N@@ ases and laugh@@ ing against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the rab@@ bits of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still lives and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed , among other things , a drawer for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figur@@ ines cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , working nearly ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches continue to find his dro@@ ll figures worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand feet as an opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie coming to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions inherent in dro@@ ught and due to the diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , prepare large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small brick , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf block@@ ages , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions taken into consideration include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 20th anniversary this year .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants , or a detention centre should be able to experience these days in the city center .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drugs wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with Gar@@ nets in 2009 or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal discomfort suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists have been there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been in office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez , in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters during the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process journalists &quot; cases , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely tried by journalists .
in Fe@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated to &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country because rival fac@@ tions are struggling here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bors and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez became aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken the blame for not protecting his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
initially , in February , the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected crew members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second f@@ law was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drugs problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug hist@@ ories wherever it led .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task you acc@@ use as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret start and landing areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range area of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not trusted by the governor themselves .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has focused on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing institutional revolution party ( PR@@ I ) , which almost all the century ruled all political planes .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this area , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez took a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ mi disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say it is its own based on DNA tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country journalists have become lou@@ der by writing down in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they said the truth .
she has been asked since then to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her fur@@ y has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a society of equal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am for my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the Dru@@ gs cart@@ el with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with gang riv@@ els and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the ker@@ b edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens lift up nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez glan@@ ced at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid of it , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening one .
scientists have now found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even see that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reserved din@@ osau@@ r who has ever been found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ r copies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth dump@@ s .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will come into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing shell , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better in his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ m@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ad@@ fast@@ ness , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the con@@ ter@@ shade is usual , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ ving animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure from eating meat din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ad@@ owing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intestinal content to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank down to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the du@@ sty arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips hanging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the Hau@@ trage &apos;s most beautiful arm@@ oured plates lay along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y pl@@ ating plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilometre @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon on a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , at 17.00 hr@@ s. between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed .
the exact number of injured persons initially did not provide any information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large amount of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the city of Munich a ten @-@ kilometer long back@@ stab@@ au was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also on the counter @-@ track to massive disabilities - through numerous caff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade registered the characteristics of the car drivers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ches .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : there is nothing like sitting on the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
if the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ hip or sn@@ aps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn ( Deutsche Bahn ) is currently testing the driver @-@ less ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and thereby inv@@ ali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway the de@@ valuation without the conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which anyway most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased through the app from the railway , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of booking the ticket .
and la@@ stly , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the test customers a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will appear .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket control at square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew , simply check out the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to person@@ alize their time by train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of Deutsche Bank &apos;s Marketing Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances .
because often one has , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to present .
the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger , which leads to bad spirits in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just a day after she arrived in New York City , the Queen of St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed fac@@ ebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly res@@ cu@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was involved in the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police tape and people crying out and by a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we got used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt sha@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence , which consists of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her along , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blat@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rel@@ l began to take shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has completely changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came in Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as follows recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death @-@ wing det@@ ain@@ ees .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , because this is how I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ el &apos;s experience - to show that the movement is &quot; not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life as she falls in love with her and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed as she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the movie &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women have to wear the main burden of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sha@@ ken up that energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the communications cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels obliged to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV reader discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold , the subject hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit @-@ gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; Das would be really clas@@ sy &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is then bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; for many years we have been shopping for almost a week in the farmers market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers always like again .
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop was discovered for us .
we would like to see that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is that too .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing direc@@ ts in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping m@@ est in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , drug stores or supermarkets : I think it is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is plenty of it in our city .
you can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms , because the local r@@ ents are often not bear@@ able for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a pity , special shops almost no longer exist and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall be used during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or manages the spec@@ ter bit gallery previously to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping centre that stands empty does not need anybody .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fitting resem@@ b@@ lance : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which resem@@ ble almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year cust@@ odi@@ al sentence after being published as a secret diplomatic report on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A fitting resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ figure and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde per@@ ch - with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became un@@ equal letters of letters , which in the course of two years ex@@ changeable several letters .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert Over@@ seas Jud@@ gment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , to call Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome form of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tru@@ mp is launching a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen to happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the sophisticated scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a site from the above mentioned comic book .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she emerges with a free speech phone in her hand from the disciplinary powers of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they talk about your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never keep your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ors that rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea as the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who were sought as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ they ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several bites .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago police authorities states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of action , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them has now been judged and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help US investig@@ ators in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Office of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insist@@ ed on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip who said that something happened in 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation for the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has obtained the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of US @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian point of sale r@@ sports at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to un@@ condition@@ ally accept this report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the use of dop@@ ing control in Russia as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA general director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ USA@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be re @-@ deployed .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is at the growth in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , provide specific groups and demo@@ graphics groups , to address employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite executives and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .
companies are expected to remain at the forefront of workplace culture , so that you will not be the nearest neighbour who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments &apos;s finance website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the chief business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , issues that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or unfair internship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , following the collapse of the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen due to ethical breach of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both startups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , thus raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partner and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions .
the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes , and that the work they do is worth it , they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , dis@@ appointment can breed dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , people will wonder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported to ret@@ ort .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11 p.m. , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a mid@@ day break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center at 6 : 30 am next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ck @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually leng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ges moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
20 before the start of the formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he will support N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s rule changes even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ick further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been thrown by foot balls , which is a protective grid behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task .
brood @-@ Players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then sett@@ ling there to draw up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good business .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false report reviews to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual sur@@ vey@@ ors that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan on which social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts check was started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories from third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
building a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says enthusias@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emo@@ tionally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell after smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is doing so .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with coun@@ try@@ men , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who possessed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let &apos;s go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ pex Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ rol , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; in which the S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be pretty ga@@ unt , getting debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise in . &quot;
after the end of his efforts at the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ am experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the wrapping of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too good for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
as a matter of fact , we are convinced that as bad Honne@@ fer citizens , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the action , it is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other commun@@ es .
the town of Bad Honnef is able to cost an average five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) cons@@ ults on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the consultations .
so the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of State Erd@@ og@@ an has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as the re@@ porter of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week is being negotiated in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had described the attempt to overthrow the &quot; gift of God &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an really has the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ity in Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mu@@ ff@@ ing ban for soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great thing in the army and security forces is continuing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an ordered a decree to fire a further 7@@ 3@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were older than the actual lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an is target@@ ing Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the attempted put@@ sch from fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , in the alliance with the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries are spent on Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for racing bus shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the race car has been cont@@ ested again and again - now it is supposed to go quite fast .
before the end of the year , the route is to be built on the mar@@ qu@@ ished road on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the road rally in the long term , construction work will start on the track this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained traffic secretary Klaus At@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the track was approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ pped 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle shall also be ordered by the country in the future , is currently fin@@ alised , declared expi@@ ation .
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as operator are already in agreement about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot operation in the past months , it has been tested to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ alt@@ able .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry
just when you thought that it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sl@@ ings have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would make a Step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sl@@ ings have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attrac@@ tively , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ies ? &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
her emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will , of course , not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R sees its increasing popularity , they remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ases out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offen@@ ding until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain intersection that this highly developed sex robot will emerge in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been bo@@ ther@@ ing to have attacked women sexually .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The maid &apos;s report &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid girls
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of human dignity
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that political divisions , which pol@@ arized U.S. voters , also split families in small format .
in the US newspapers around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were papers about how to deal with the hor@@ r@@ ors of Tru@@ mp .
we are all re@@ port@@ edly strict to let our filter bubbles burst .
less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ wing den@@ ser , who lives in Chicago and has been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom they had fought for decades on account of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp but the pres@@ ump@@ tuous effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer rep@@ el us .
there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I find myself trapped by an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp were indeed a very mild crime .
when Tru@@ mp is concerned , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ sparkling music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , since two two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same plus the option to reconci@@ le the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ ins@@ ingly , while I tired of the experience to reach her credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year cust@@ odi@@ al sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

three of the students will go to college in the future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 pupils of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der selected a young eag@@ les growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eagle in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it br@@ anded by his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken @-@ clo@@ ak , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of having a hen come out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore cylinders to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young@@ ster may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ mill@@ er to feel accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a letter of thank@@ fulness to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always comes into teaching and the parents of the parents .
the cum@@ ber@@ some time now is over , said class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
they leave their students only very reluc@@ t@@ antly after two years of teaching , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door lum@@ ber@@ ths .
finally , all students were greeted with a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ time candidates have already registered for the new school year .
arrested two Bulg@@ arians due to illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial money pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls will be continued throughout the entire season .
the Ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation within the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler announced to write to everyone concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be carried out in its framework .
how long will the retro@@ fitting fit in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive decline in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first z@@ apper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ orable .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to abst@@ ain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tru@@ mp &apos;s talk to make her view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the earlier pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners count Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Engineer , will go to R@@ ente next year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work still makes him a lot of fun as he is conveyed in the press talk .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it surprised that so far , no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time to work in compliance with the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as the Lower Construction Law Authority , the applicant has to present corresponding degrees .
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill it out , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the town is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and a good atmosphere between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking area have been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium restoration is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will be beating with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it properly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a city builder .
with Has@@ la@@ chs own yard and gardening we can react very flexibly to many .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often men@@ tion@@ ned by citizens and visitors .
since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city master builder emphasizes .
in any case , the City Engineer contributes a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach , a completed academic degree or a Bachelor &apos;s degree course should be able to instruc@@ t architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of civil engineering and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt engaged high and civil engineering , construction planning , basic employment opportunities , management of urban properties , municipal building yard with building yard and urban gar@@ dener as well as lower building rights authority including historic monument protection .
bicycle is thrown on lines : road track locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ oben ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships .
these were badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators depart from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night hours .
close to the crime scene , a sco@@ oter and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is region , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator and the perpetr@@ ators would have threatened themselves in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also pay attention to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South @-@ Rail@@ road could be led without obstruc@@ tions .
almost ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning , two of them saw the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains were not cancelled , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( Infl@@ ammat@@ ory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States affects stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without har@@ ming sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han nour@@ ishes more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el disease , if the same system affects people .
the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been kept separate , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice failed .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then introduced small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &quot; feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million Po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ ses in the keeper &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched forward .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pro@@ visi@@ oning Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho got its start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority commitments .
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft maker Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo in the sky was painted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is rotating : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire @-@ fire from the party headquarters , merely a counter @-@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz led the party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus has been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with head@@ wind in the approach .
they were civil engineering .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green cannot be ruled out reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tion@@ ist of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green German managing director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ ests to return their mandate to the revol@@ ting Dutch Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergence of the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal managing director and campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she si@@ ghs an SPD suff@@ erer when the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the emergence of the Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ests .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what will happen next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ ere &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saarland election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a blue eye , no more , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at its time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the pi@@ er , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te put the party smoothly .
the comrades ra@@ ced again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just acquired new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep beat .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD president , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because he was making pretty wrong in the crisis communication afterwards , what could be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already stood in the criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the league over the past few weeks .
the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party internal compul@@ sion of the Dutch Green Party .
and Mr Schulz not at all .
at times the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ests sets forth their own career interests over the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate for her person , but has been elected by the state list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Lower Saxon MEP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
subsi@@ dy Programs for Local III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives announced city development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what was happening .
since 1991 I have been giving in sensi@@ cal rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to also promote internal development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium , Karlsruhe , received the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros were from the country , the rest from the community sensi@@ bilities .
how do we create a remedi@@ ation area ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area in general , to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area limits could then be moved again .
the bar represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would then finally be established as a statute .
the grant period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey would take place only once , in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation sector to fill out a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the Stat@@ utes should be carried out as soon as possible , so that the next year can be started with the refur@@ bish@@ ments .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every Commune had to carry out the said preliminary examinations .
it is about evaluating and deciding on the urban situation and decide when it is being rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective parcel there will be a notice of improvement in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sensation and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property Arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the rehabilitation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing arch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , division and inhabitants of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if the premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that Got@@ zel has pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphasized that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or is putting a micro@@ chip on his own in order to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military provided to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut Hel@@ icop@@ ter was on display in addition to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ cons@@ in fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter car and a fork lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landing on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Military Commander for Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news indicated that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security guards of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane .
from the recordings made available by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the assistant commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet was running against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the Pres@@ idential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the assistant secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 launched 58 practice sessions in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters were also flying 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting up the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Defense Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter lies far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press spokesperson for the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ g@@ ade car .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp was speaking to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
the leader of the second tennis league will compete in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V in the third league .
the TC Blau @-@ White Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V in Kiel .
despite having five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League has won the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high north are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ bru@@ ck ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , who is playing in the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella , manages to make it his first bet during this season .
the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo , yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was still at the front of the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should also be present in Kiel as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories over the last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move back to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the Train@@ er@@ ab of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US .
at least , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from O@@ MV , together with other European companies , are concerned with the construction of North Stream 2 in Russia .
the dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
Donald Tru@@ mp should actually raise the sanctions against life by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is centered around Net@@ fli@@ x in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third squ@@ ad@@ ron , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites US and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
further new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry B@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
role back : the city provides 46 kitchen aid
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch time again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turning back in the urban day@@ care centres .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supplies in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooked .
the city runs 46 day@@ care centers in the area of Kre@@ feld , in 44 children receive a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
last year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 week@@ days are eating in the K@@ ita at lunch@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have a kitchen service starting from 1 September : they warm up the cooked foods , supplement them with salads , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides about the timet@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the capitalist to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about eating healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be completed by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power , has also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical , is it from the Press Office .
and this , even though 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly with about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5th . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat actions to a consult@@ ative role .
this year , elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to information from the police , the men addressed the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stopped with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
then one of the offen@@ ders tried to seize the cell phone and the neck of the girl , which , however , mis@@ beha@@ ved .

G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to as@@ certain at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company weigh@@ ed about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which besides other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
in recent years Mc@@ Vi@@ ties &apos;s owner of Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the store manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; expressing concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentrated on the local community and the large space Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bran@@ ch at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react immediately as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives should be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not lag behind in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar after issuing a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the League 1 Club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous stamp , where Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar enforced its way outside , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans that the club always had its best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G pres@@ idency before this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign by themselves , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association put an interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

in an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses .
because a car hit him in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the circuit board .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um came from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
damage to the car was caused by the passenger car .
the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident victims , it may well be good that the driver did not notice the accident at all .
the police now requested witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the caus@@ ation expert to contact the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au at Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves &quot; Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , Spe@@ aker of the Reform@@ ist Movement , &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ fied Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would be very useful to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ ars would be measured with &quot; two measure . &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we love to go to the church and this is a bound fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared in connection with the reports on mis@@ use cases .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber has presented with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 dome cats .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary it can be said that , in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims fail to estimate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even bring positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal associated with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against the victims of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students emphas@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a dom@@ ic@@ ure brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
to him , eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspici@@ on of accompli@@ ce or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence in the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
it is possible to blame him at best , to know it too late or to have taken initial indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz gymn@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he worked , was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ lag@@ ged by children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to rage erup@@ tions .
that he not only b@@ angs with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also put ear @-@ files distributed and too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys moved to the hair or ears , he has already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time , the 1960s and 1970s , both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violent exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are ad@@ mitt@@ edly dre@@ d@@ ging .
you wonder if it doesn &apos;t have to do with its fame and its role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .
many people who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently in the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report a great deal was reported about the topic abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also accused of any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults alle@@ ges to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they don &apos;t even commit themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the dom@@ ine@@ j@@ ab students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the relevant perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also to be really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ilt are more urgent or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus exemp@@ ted from any collabor@@ ator .
so he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these gru@@ es@@ ome crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence Ex@@ pression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former head master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is a mis@@ use of the report .
it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
the report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were ch@@ ic@@ led and portra@@ yed , and who were horri@@ bly dist@@ ressed , all took place at pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled out .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he got the boys first when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on that , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme of &quot; primary school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; states .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , combine even positive memories with him . &quot;
at the most , the blame remains to have taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the conditions at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut his ears in front of the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended advance .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test sentences were long ago banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that is simply not true .
it was not until 1980 that the death penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess has already been right .
but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ r@@ able at all times , and not for what was vom@@ ited in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ vers@@ ity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all horrible and I &apos;m happy that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so to make ear @-@ files and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg period did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger see in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ fer penalty also come to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the Cathedral Pi@@ eces played only a minor role .
in spite of this , I did not at all hide that he carried out a stric@@ test regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ ce from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not make a big singer and any success from un@@ ru@@ ly boys , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of man did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through work in the book and beyond , I have really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , deeply believing and heart @-@ good person , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something on a fly .
I get regular contact with how many former dom@@ ic@@ ans still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who have not forgiven him to this day , that he was once strictly among them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the domain names are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good father of father - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up and which they are down@@ right ven@@ er@@ ated .
and please , once again , clearly : all you have accused of him are educational methods that were on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind , only too obvious .
because the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the stand would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know Germany the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
