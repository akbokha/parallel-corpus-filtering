<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former land of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them to current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickering tapestry, which you cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, detailed maps, so-called primitive documents, were incorporated into the cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying authorities between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally pulling off with the Lunéville's peace of 9 February 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide campaign of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max. Joseph made the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau," and thus the Bavarian surveying authorities.</seg>
<seg id="19">The documentary collection for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was registered 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today there is Untersendling in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbers from the so-called "Urination" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots are no longer evidence of farmers, but farmers of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 was the scene of the Oktoberfest, was indeed a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there in 1858 / 59 the Munich District-Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was born." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time, and for example ended the greasing of the so-called" "" "Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the prison.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk rrente in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Hospital in Munich-Ost, Germany, has been one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people from the Munich Salesianum are now on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV Munich east is located to the west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architecturally reminiscent of the original construction of the Irrenia, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn root route.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich-Map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Committee published travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to Promoting Farms has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, demands afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention to travel through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents happen in the entire state and be noted here," stated in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement authorities, which disproportionately target minorities, set out the group to release the warning," "" "said the NAACP." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights which happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are held because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted cases like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline at all while traveling through the state and taken custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office in which black motorists in the state are considered to be 75 percent more often than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to take deposits or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classified the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warnings are also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling in the opinion of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weidezvn project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-town association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Brudemann family graveyard.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his operation, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young and accommodated in five apartments Feriengeti.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing way for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengarist only Regionales come.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the fence project as" "" "fundamental importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot manage such steep areas profitably.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, much needs to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "he stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental plant and cultivated it without any chemical plant protection and fertiliser even if it does not lead to bioactivity.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the advancement of leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">With a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of their support</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced off by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">Thus, the open-wing surface is 40 hectares not allowed to be explored until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of €71 500 was funded by the local leader, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "for Peter Weiss, too, stood firm:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape conservation line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state subsidy of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of a conveying background recorded by LPR is a prerequisite.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the fence must not be tractor-bearing (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2009 Fiscal Weidezvous Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-plan surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its importance, and in particular the meaning it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta said," "" "I don't want to go down here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your faines, your poor, and your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely, the miserable garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-up classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty calls no one, but rather an early neo-conservative, who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not be lit for the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh is encountered here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense that seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle appeals to a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the power director of the United Kingdom's athletics track, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championship" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buteau - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m route while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her speech speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidan made quite naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, competing in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir goes along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1.500 m and 5,000 m of runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle appeals to her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about team captains is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on platforms.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the voters' home</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was sucking him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a reciprocal action with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary head of heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - is a public forum, which is officially designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse advocated the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I am polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area of the news" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I do not value this idea, if a number of people occupies the same issue, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what marked the governor's staff as a" "" "concentrated spam attack" "", "others would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook-era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters put on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"" "the people who used pseudonyms such as" "" "Juricola" "", "" "" "Valerius" "", "" "" "Belisarius" "" "and" "" "Portius" "" "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions." ""</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticised his point of view of the Amity treaty, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>

<seg id="409">The survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also stated that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-trade assa Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the continuously triumphant figures on sales increases and even more giant sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk first revealed another, less brilliant figure for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk often had advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car whose delivery just commences.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk says: 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non-binding booking.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euro (in the USA 1000 USD and in Great Britain 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 of such non-binding reservations envisage, spacial musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be put together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently available per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-tested production lines without any major disruptions at maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of the Church of St. Hilarius: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery site in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Ursembuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogbey "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the deed of the document, apart from the former parish church, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the Church or the right of patronage and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So people also lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"" "as from the description of the" "" "Oberstale Freudenstadt" "" "dating from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the" "" "mountain" "" "of the third, the splendid village of the village." ""</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 are subject to historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeathed this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a parish priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two fell apart at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church mill and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumbllingen University Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the St. Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's 8 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower which still exists today remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenbach and Rolf-Dieter Vasiem are the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, friends and supporters invite tumours on Sunday 16th July, to the Sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>

<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="908">The construction date is scheduled for October and Light is sure that the schedule is kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fixing that is also used as an operating system.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the south side of the bridge, a bridge cap of 2.20 metres should be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special flair of the fingers has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fiber cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">Local residents were informed about the project prior to the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building-yard-building and the collection-pond in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated lane-lane by a traffic light.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Financial Rules of Football affect Neymars Move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization controlling the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG had to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose for Neymar to sign it and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they have to deal with legitimate sources of income, which allow them to break even the break-even point in their activities related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, which had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year lease period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015, the UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds will be posted for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it has been arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to outsource their financial supervision by blaming their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsoring was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar will be a World Cup ambassador and a great manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will still be more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and they tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1162">According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1166">The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the order volume in accordance with "North West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a car manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss will not want to betray the number of applicants with the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss producers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article Chocolat Frey wants to strive for a renewal of the treaty in the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sd, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not able to reach an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael showed the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our facebook-capable era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time would be scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By getting stiff at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who are adults now, is less emotionally rooted and his parody leaves more after the watering can principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90-s, like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that cries the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character falls through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another insane-evil plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, excourses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's lip-beard by "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental delusions that could heighten this franchise like a kind of repetitive Seven Up! "series until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion:" Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, "whose last scene will show the band's premiere of" Wet Hot American Summer. "</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon commemorates another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his east-to-west wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka pays homage to a bound TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Ching Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching chess on TV how Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides for an ongoing game 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "", "which was edited on a lower length, could better deliver its Agitprop Satire, since Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a forage for a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1213">15 defendants were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>

<seg id="1215">In the case of simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably shipped to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators took part in the action.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living big life: mezzanine and clever designer cheats have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne patio - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet have been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally an one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted Joanne Storage and an mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above one another, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which could be found.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage serine mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars from Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went inside," "" "Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is opposite, so when you push the door very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch you and which can help create emotional ties in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of something standard into something amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>

<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk-bars and delicacy businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970's.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and failed.</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>

<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consequently been able to prevent Trump from producing controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about advising the advisers to bring forward dubious information to the president for strategic reasons." ""</seg>

Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and revoked them.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming into the administrative district, the hotel building was offered to the County Council as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>

<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice-gargants that have registered researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to the research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cream in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facet background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was up to now a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhagus floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this cowardstick the balance of growth and abrupt was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete cowardice is broken down there, writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am talking about the fact that the Larsen-C-cowardis are also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far removed as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melt melt and ice-berg do not increase the sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it follows after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth largest shelf of Antarctica after AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and that we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists it is disputed whether the Larsen-C Schelhags will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not trace the outbreak of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many cuddules of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic streches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the last 50 years and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to help house-arif personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to step out of the employer's association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the round of the chalk-day saw 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and clerks work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now, 17 trainees now have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously very desired.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were posted for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as powers of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">"" "" "" "the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration shall" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the application scarcity in a future-oriented manner.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a veritable" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This results in a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Thus, high time to act, so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been worried about a great surprise in the chalk-day, when he publicly challenged personnel costs and amazes the rest of the parties.</seg>

<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-related towns - a house tariff," "" "says peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards years of work.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least, by the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>

<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "" "said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis caution came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet', because their crew worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which was in operation only a year ago, refused to comment on the allegations of the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had watched the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew will take inflatable immigrants aboard, which are delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor's Act, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of being overruled by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have in particular an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be far more often present on these markets online than to send the Swiss approval to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">During e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the FIFA soccer simulation will be contested on a competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sports, leagues have become established in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>

<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drugs wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with Garnets in 2009 or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal discomfort suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's payroll list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists have been there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been in office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez, in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters during the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special public prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process journalists "cases, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Feodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting and although the terrain is even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated to "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country because rival factions are struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbors and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez became aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken the blame for not protecting his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially, in February, the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected crew members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second flaw was not to force Valdez to leave the country after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drugs problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug histories wherever it led.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trusted by the governor themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing institutional revolution party (PRI), which almost all the century ruled all political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shadfastness, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the contershade is usual, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is by far the surviving animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from eating meat dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter shadowing - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was subjected to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life, including his preserved intestinal content to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank down to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the dusty armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips hanging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the Hautrage's most beautiful armoured plates lay along the dinosaur</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold, the subject hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit-gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "Das would be really classy" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is then bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which resemble almost imperceptibly - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year custodial sentence after being published as a secret diplomatic report on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A fitting resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfigure and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde perch - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse became unequal letters of letters, which in the course of two years exchangeable several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili's Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would convert Overseas Judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, to call Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome form of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump is launching a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things happen to happen for a certain reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for the "i" in her surname (the "i" in her family name) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the sophisticated scientific lexicon of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, too.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a site from the above mentioned comic book.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who were sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathey (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died, 26, after several bites.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Chicago police authorities states that the body was discovered on 27 July.</seg>

<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of action, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects said officials.</seg>

<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list stipulates that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of US-funded doping in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "with regard to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity" "", "said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Association Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is at the growth in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, provide specific groups and demographics groups, to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-suite executives and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are expected to remain at the forefront of workplace culture, so that you will not be the nearest neighbour who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the Let's Talk Payments's finance website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent enables companies to send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has used for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, issues that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair internship.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, following the collapse of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen due to ethical breach of the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media" "" "came to their right," "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitter secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partner and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only missions.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes, and that the work they do is worth it, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, disappointment can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you don't follow, people will wonder" "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employees surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about Glint is reported to retort.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just when you thought that it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," "" "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern slings have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adjust" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of nipples to the type or colour of his finger nails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "who would make a Stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern slings have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractively, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the RoxxxGold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "RoxxxGold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxies?"</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will, of course, not keep sex robots, and while the FRR sees its increasing popularity, they remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpases out of the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offending until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain intersection that this highly developed sex robot will emerge in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been bothering to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The maid's report ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical likeness to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maid girls</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps's great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of human dignity</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that political divisions, which polarized U.S. voters, also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the US newspapers around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were papers about how to deal with the horrors of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reportedly strict to let our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing denser, who lives in Chicago and has been working with the republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship, with whom they had fought for decades on account of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also entails significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump but the presumptuous effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself trapped by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both in comparison to Trump were indeed a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is concerned, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York carousels, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimsparkling music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience, since two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same plus the option to reconcile the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing grinsingly, while I tired of the experience to reach her credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing her through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecutor's Office said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection may be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States affects stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan nourishes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system affects people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been kept separate, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice failed.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then introduced small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice "feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2672">Who wants to renovate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives announced city development on Wednesday in sensation.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidium, Karlsruhe, received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros were from the country, the rest from the community sensibilities.</seg>

<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would then finally be established as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey would take place only once, in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation sector to fill out a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the Statutes should be carried out as soon as possible, so that the next year can be started with the refurbishments.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves" Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, Speaker of the Reformist Movement, "We are the Church," declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerified Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that reporting on violence in the Domspars would be measured with "two measure."</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we love to go to the church and this is a bound fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "punches" "" "were" "" "a normal educational tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with the reports on misuse cases.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorabilia "My brother of the pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber has presented with the Enlightenment from the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 dome cats.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary it can be said that, in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims fail to estimate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even bring positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal associated with the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against the victims of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen," is a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students emphasise" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a domicure brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">To him, eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of accomplice or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence in the preschool also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to blame him at best, to know it too late or to have taken initial indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium" "" "Domspatz gymnasium" "" "on which he worked, was perceived as" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony, describes him as" "" "warm-hearted" "", "" "" "sincere" "", "" "" "sincere" "", "" "" "competent" "" "and" "" "understanding" "", "which provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" "" "was always" "" "enlagged by children." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he not only bangs with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also put ear-files distributed and too naughty boys moved to the hair or ears, he has already admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time, the 1960s and 1970s, both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violent excesses at the preschool, they are admittedly dredging.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it doesn't have to do with its fame and its role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who never understood him are still working diligently in the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report a great deal was reported about the topic abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assaults alleges to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral-kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even commit themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the dominejab students rate Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the relevant perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also to be really absurd to assume that... Built are more urgent or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus exempted from any collaborator.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these gruesome crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "Violence Expression" "" "was read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former head master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "Look away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases where boys from sadistic teachers were chicled and portrayed, and who were horribly distressed, all took place at preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he got the boys first when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme of "primary school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, combine even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the blame remains to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the conditions at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the pre-school the punishment will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended advance.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test sentences were long ago banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was not until 1980 that the death penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "snare of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrable at all times, and not for what was vomited in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all horrible and I'm happy that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so to make ear-files and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger see in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüfer penalty also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the Cathedral Pieces played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In spite of this, I did not at all hide that he carried out a strictest regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trance from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not make a big singer and any success from unruly boys, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work in the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, deeply believing and heart-good person, from which one can't imagine that he could do something on a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with how many former domicans still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he was once strictly among them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain names are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
