a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the Court of Justice in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was clas@@ sed as a murder and the investigations were running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who earlier worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are during this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his way of connecting with his family was to always bring us something to cook , to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the event will be asked to call the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or past@@ ed from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather u@@ pro@@ cal to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , a TV with a lo@@ cker@@ le de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is bringing the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us as of August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the World Pyr@@ amid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden World Pyr@@ amid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to the feed trou@@ ghs in fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he had his family run over the system of the AL@@ FA , on a horse he did not even shoot for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports aid delivered the Golden Sport pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala .
there are no awards for the symp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen ad@@ ored him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long is the 18 winner of the pyramid of sport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering young talents .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Toys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , former Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , Rud@@ der Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Sho@@ ck öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Manu@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Preis was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to prevent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
that , about the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively go back to regulations , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the contrary , says : the state has certain tasks to accomplish , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in which it has to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical parti@@ san wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans strictly .
so there could be no parti@@ san discussions on Tru@@ mp .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the U.S. again .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection treaty wants to cancel it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , with its investment programme , Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , asking for instance Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 USD is a hunger .
he wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this issue is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must arise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics regard him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every escaped woman experiences sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby who is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one talks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria , and she deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs established the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich @-@ based women &apos;s help .
it has long been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hop@@ eful@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , pat@@ ron@@ age , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that tu@@ gs are demanding sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , Irish , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in worst cases .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich @-@ based Northern states are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations just for them , Requ@@ ires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia women are not separated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or men and women stay together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is included in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush they give to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistance Veter@@ in@@ arians strike : demands for new employment Camp@@ aig@@ n
assistant veter@@ in@@ arians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work @-@ fighting measures in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) requested its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor actions starting in early September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC stated that ministers agreed to address the concerns of the treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed to reject a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently cal@@ med &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and demand official ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today placed a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labor camp measures that begin early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians in this year strike six times , the first complete failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA Assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y H@@ unt , said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed decent and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - a whole five times according to a report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved as if something had happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustained cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was rage .
Putin testified and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger , as it was done by a presum@@ ed friend .
building the Vet@@ our@@ ites again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
the alleg@@ ations were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse by President Erdoğan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been det@@ ained almost to his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey severely - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian import was allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry to the West because its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power is regarded as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment of the sn@@ ail emp@@ athy of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , he called for support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ amor@@ ous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel ill @-@ treated and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents were saying that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided responding to a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey ab@@ rup@@ tly pushed the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State would at least speak again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland customers
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for Scotland customers .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national stamps .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralised headquarters and stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank &apos;s brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the retail business , which will gain more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it won &apos;t be the Six Nations sponsor@@ ing anymore and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night at Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ ering when he pi@@ cks up on pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ minute winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ ist had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career victories
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been in the UK for almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fy his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his form .
and he &apos;s not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue at competitions up to his age of at least 5@@ 0,@@ 00@@ s .

Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief executive and chief of staff of the government care@@ gi@@ ver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he did for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official claim - that a man , who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to put your trust in a job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term in office , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term had viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation with the set of the series in Los Angeles for the last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his termination on Thursday .
the set led to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gib@@ son is written out of the series that follows a team of FB@@ I agents , will probably be published at a later date , according to the Opinion of the ABC studios and C@@ BS television studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who had previously played in Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .

Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ wear Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ i cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are near@@ ing completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown today made a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering masterpiece of a truly epic achievement in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is getting a seat for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the future @-@ oriented high and low @-@ rise building .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck situated in the expansion , we had to close the existing gap on the northern or land side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern tow@@ ing bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances on which the team works were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bu@@ o@@ y hanging without a life@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it released the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone is w@@ aking up today about these men .
heavy hurt - man smo@@ kes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic off@@ ender cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when he came into the apartment , he went twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend he called his mother .
this al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old st@@ owed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds economical dwell@@ ings from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens think : investors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the argument is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should really build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments will have to be used as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
the great controversy in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such surfaces to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing support programme that will cost millions and must still be financed will provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the political groups at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prec@@ ep@@ ts as possible .
the Left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
regardless of that , as Brat@@ mann , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is still not entirely new : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of further around 1300 low @-@ priced homes , whose support will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
to prevent this , such as the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought @-@ out bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of re@@ covering the apartments back into price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the west city , deadlines start at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not mean the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased again , it is removed from the aim of the so @-@ called confusion .
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ poor in just a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be any movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must go with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch the world changes .
that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their spare time on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and la@@ stly confined to smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop@@ culture phenomena , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation playing the game when she was younger , joined the boat and jump@@ ed for the search from the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person returns every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game , the number of tra@@ cked people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent jump@@ ed to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees raw data for increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look aw@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships .
as always there are m@@ ural players who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what shall it be ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
definitely brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ki@@ cked on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es sculp@@ ts on the floating beam during the solo campaign for women in the artistic gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American winning a multi @-@ campaign title and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ ly won the last three years her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises which include a mixture of ambition and precision , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver each in the solo arena of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ lion took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired man co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insist@@ ed , during their long journey to the top , never planned to have the future planned , this is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which included her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since summer 2013 she hasn &apos;t lost a competition competition any more , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was slightly led by two rot@@ ations , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Swedish beams and floor @-@ teeth - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she again got up with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still sat on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her de@@ der@@ g@@ ust - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on bil@@ lowing shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercise she cast a com@@ eback to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful .
as far as cheap is concerned , the rapidly spreading twe@@ ets of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old have a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ous appl@@ ause when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is reading in the report .
the police stated that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in his@@ panic residen@@ ces within four months in nine attacks and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several cars , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his ancestors , Ed@@ mund &apos;s Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I couldn &apos;t make it .
I don &apos;t manage that .
wher@@ eu@@ pon I did not let myself alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I did not know that people are still doing &apos; , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age and he can still not speak .
but it is slow progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund explained for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
violent rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ area floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it was reck@@ oned up all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , agreed that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts of the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inch rain could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama there was a flood warning system on Friday as it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream flash floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these flows through the assigned rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , ever recorded .
rescue teams still sli@@ pped people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved close to Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose overnight greatly .
he said that another son of the son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water poured in and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommodated up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer placed near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil had been considerably fully absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and teaching activity in five school districts .
the WW@@ L affiliate reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua attacked 200 in@@ und@@ ated houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches now both being flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by the floo@@ ds .
emergency shel@@ ters were set up in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond to accommodate the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the high water and sand bags for the inhabitants were provided , hoping to be able to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the Municipal Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Rupert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday until now .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; kno@@ cked out of bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the lo@@ ins , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was conscious of his transportation to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , pi@@ erc@@ ing his small body with bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter that it is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is found in a critical condition , reported to the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ took the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the road , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here , there seems to be several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ sen@@ di , the police station in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still seek a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine at the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ licon , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one female female female was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ a@@ war@@ in and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ m@@ tik@@ routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold in an individual campaign for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gymn@@ as@@ tics across the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie were all beating the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four players in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and is primarily involved in private trainers , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , furnishing , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ners and families ) . the list can be continued as desired .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the churches un@@ coun@@ table young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy to access exercise .
I have founded my gymn@@ astic foundation for 20 years .
during my events , we have offered free and affordable floors in Harlem for over 15,000 young people ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organize additional strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted in a vote rejected him .
in July , H@@ unt announced plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS had found itself in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance physicians should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend packages to improve maintenance at irregular times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Committee on Assist@@ ance Physi@@ cians distributed last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns regarding the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce and admini@@ ster it to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the B@@ MA for resol@@ ving disputes through dialogue came to take part in the government on reluc@@ t@@ ance and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was one of the promises that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt made earlier this month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , raise the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment and address the worries of assistance physicians . &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out additional work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of almost 13@@ ,000 routine sur@@ geri@@ es and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were consul@@ ted to cover doctors on the stri@@ k@@ post chain .
the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better weekend compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of the N@@ HS staff , asked the assistance physicians to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work Camp@@ aig@@ ns do not achieve nothing of the only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , the pa@@ ws and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the committee of assistance physicians and responded positively to the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whist@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , additional training courses for those who come from a vocational training , training lists , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health on compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form bel@@ lows .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons already having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots less likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack , have a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already have a heart attack .
with a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes election fraud grow in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating governance report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former member of the cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an Ant@@ inous King , said that intim@@ id@@ ation by voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ tive cab@@ s to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
he suggests that voters should have a card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes not to put removable ink on the finger of a person if they give up their votes in order to prevent someone choosing twice .
whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he claims that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but should also protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s Choice V@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court ruled that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which a person el@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly alar@@ ming with the frau@@ dul@@ ent selection of letters - in the case of the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guidance of wise men to prove their identity .
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ an backgrounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric recommended 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists will process letter in@@ discrimin@@ ately to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , demands also tough@@ er registration dos@@ si@@ ers to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your identity card .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person once she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic selection of letters .
prohibition of political activ@@ ist working full envel@@ op@@ es and envel@@ op@@ es of postal choices .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change in the law , which facilit@@ ated an accus@@ ation of intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
no photography in poll@@ ing stations .
request that only English may be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the staff generally enforce that voters go alone to the poll@@ ing cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the town halls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election registration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy according to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger von Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio won this week by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , out of the rim and band , which has proved to be an impressive double @-@ person of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing for gold , which has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you can trust the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the moment on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the racing track , many people on the Internet were pointing out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a storm on Twitter after pictures depicting the Wolf of Wall Street Star in a very similar way .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see a great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess this is a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes shall be able to pass through as a double @-@ han@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice who showed similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was credited with an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC Com@@ mentary for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds Analysis on 4th Place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 100m free @-@ sty@@ led audience of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year old Chinese swi@@ mmer was &quot; as low as &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ style floating staff@@ el he gave his own opinions .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; paint , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went as low as a pig , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , allowing Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ my@@ twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer of China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m release staff@@ el for women in the following way : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard .
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ si@@ ze@@ bel B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ro Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like Ras@@ si@@ sten . # be@@ ek@@ ed .
short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end for more than 90 times with the people who had responded to the comment on Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC cop@@ ed and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be em@@ itted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the programme and our consequ@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments referring to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the con@@ sign@@ ment and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the floating staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the float and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
purch@@ as@@ ers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled off her clothes amidst a prim@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
to exac@@ erb@@ ate the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled it off and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the primary business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back to the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the show@@ room , she picked up a pair of under@@ pants from the base , pulled out her own stock@@ ing trousers and trousers and ta@@ sted her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants which she obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she did not like anything , went back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone observing someone - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to think obj@@ ectively that someone would take home trousers with a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had attached her and removed them and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when approaching from behind , you should turn around as the first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
hit him with his knees in the chest and twist as the att@@ acker crow@@ s out of pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as they set the weapon on him .
at att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
move the weight on the gun at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and turning the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is done in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - unless you are a Kra@@ i Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right che@@ eks for a guide his tongue on the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller underwent a serious test by breaking down some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his train on a Euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
prior to the check@@ up of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought of rej@@ ecting the flus@@ hing button of a mig@@ rating toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the support of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he wanted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public joints to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set his immune system defini@@ tively below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , soil , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test painting showed a lumin@@ ometric figure of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet he refused to refuse , after their lumin@@ aries were over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve cleared in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ kes@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which concluded that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian on it , kin@@ dle it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative &apos;s employees found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were pav@@ ing holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn open , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I believe people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation by residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive shou@@ ting , stri@@ kers and floo@@ ds .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which is possibly torn down , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden floor@@ boards were torn
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ ved them and their partners forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were che@@ ered by a facilit@@ ated neighbor who said that her life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t worry about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we put the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family agreed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as del@@ aying is always the final step considering the Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and had to look terrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the floor .
workers in the house administration will now have to cover garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by was given a fine after being guilty of the owner of a class B Dro@@ ga in commercial len@@ i@@ ency .
she claimed that money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not adhere to the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that the del@@ aying was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not adhere to the rules of the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and to those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists to panic in Portugal after an eff@@ u@@ sive military jet flies to the beach
sun worship in Av@@ eiro , Portugal revi@@ ved the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces put an incredible crash landing
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ i@@ ent jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost far from the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they were understand@@ ably beginning to worry about the noise of the electric engines without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos on the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; twice really flew very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane crashed on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro moved in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force arrived today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats in front of the coast and so had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to see them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility due to the poor visibility due to the close proximity of the area , the aircraft flew lower than usual , but the air forces insist@@ ed that security at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , where also four people died in Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his vision .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first win in the new soccer season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash increases three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ w winner must abst@@ ain from competing with the superior C@@ up@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests with Brazil the Olympic soccer tournament .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change of leg in the course of training , which clari@@ fied the entrance question at Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in the majority of other applications will prevail .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish champion gives doubts about the fitness level of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ p @-@ up against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced yet .
Sevilla , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese MA Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the world rank@@ ster first clin@@ ched the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes in World Cup , World Cup , World Tour fin@@ alist and Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time outs they had no coaches .
they with@@ drew to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the matches to this place for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ ons pose with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight only in the first set with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the anticipated stir@@ ring match .
but nevertheless enough breathtaking ball @-@ changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ final against the German champion of European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had suffered a ri@@ b injury , was afterwards in medical care , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis alter Olympia Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; gigantic problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states , to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now gave weaknesses of his campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently appearing mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced as much as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after throwing sixteen ri@@ vals within his own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of Evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt is wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took up his well @-@ known media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
w@@ ob@@ ble republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tru@@ mp and his fellow coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors from the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , were alike .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered .
in an interview with the station CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , Tru@@ mp continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp should have threatened to strike funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of propos@@ ing the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress more strongly than their arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics : three frau@@ ds with dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro confusion .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer to her home .
the International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary revealed that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ tis@@ ans in the Olympic village .
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case to enforce their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson said .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate the assessment , &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ tis@@ ch , handed over the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ y@@ as Head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become a world champion in Peking in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics deleg@@ ate Michael Ro@@ tis@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing associations for quite some time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was un@@ common to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya occupied Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
in a series of TV reports by the ARD , there have been repeatedly alleg@@ ations that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports che@@ ating .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he was employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it was possible to demonstrate that in this sport type was surface @-@ wide and systematically lo@@ op@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shakespeare @-@ Year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival will be presenting the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled a youth room with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra &apos;s orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays a Maria become older .
she reminds herself of melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is wise , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli back the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of its movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is up @-@ to @-@ date the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York citizens did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as powerful today as it was then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , died according to reports in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago their family learned about their death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the East of London climbed to Turkey and followed a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow in a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the pres@@ idency of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell , believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased Jud@@ ge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s supreme court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he hadn &apos;t talked with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , were the lack@@ eys and assistant shel@@ ters of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the President &apos;s Office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and for Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to launch a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys is distingu@@ ishing because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes that the Calendar does .
&quot; we must return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass flight
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialog und Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany is counting on short notice with tens of thousands of people who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard anticip@@ ation of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass exo@@ dus to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand immigrants from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already crossed Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with criminal charges even months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing .
after the beaten put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state which itself takes refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compl@@ ained about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
Erd@@ og@@ an intended to increase the expression of expression to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its adher@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the c@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialog und Bildung , der Welt .
as the newspaper reports on figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum rights recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus almost 29 percent of all members of the asylum claim have been eligible ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no wage for war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual pursu@@ ers .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for stupid as yet it &apos;s not going to be : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites itself .
the locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so may not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , disper@@ se fl@@ yers and pick up voices at the end , only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let go of an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s all about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people , just as his legendary singer Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise seaf@@ ar@@ ers have got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , the Minister of the Interior , has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes the right place for election campaigns .
she has twice invited Angela Merkel to open meetings for Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; it was probably the majority from other states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , was recently published in N@@ DR .
but it is also a shame not to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U will largely abandon the usual election campaigns on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , that means Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country , it is un@@ le@@ ashing the basis that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hurt , namely where people are : village festivals , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the S &amp; D Group recently compl@@ ained 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD gained a clear victory with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and largely transfer their election campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the regional president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green ball@@ ots embar@@ k on a search for traces of local vocal ch@@ ords among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ts with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment : catering facilities suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8@@ pm , there are praise everywhere .
&quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the commen@@ cement of those responsible for the construction works is also v@@ owed , for example when it comes to the establishment of airport journeys .
since the construction site was ander@@ ed on Monday to the south and the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again there , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic passes through the town seems to go back .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says the assistant director Florian King responsible for the reloc@@ ation engineering of the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ wer@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ vices were looking for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ tic .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community increasingly requested the sen@@ sing vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made himself clear about the situation .
there are already two to three per minute baked .
the quick@@ est was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales break@@ through@@ s allows anyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. produced for other companies , has hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also cle@@ ars that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running message is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the streets along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds considerable words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it increases sales revenue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ side renovation has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the advice given that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more gener@@ ously handled .
for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it points to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now less frequ@@ ented due to the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also very nice somewhere else .
that his pedi@@ gree comes back after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
in spite of the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 works on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is brutal .
it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws in the name of the fight against terror .
after the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a large security package .
but what has a ul@@ ment status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable for the coalition partner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not demand anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he is located on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency is to take care of the un@@ encrypted communication , is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second course for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and also does not require anything in the case of the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before the deportation .
refugees that are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety check .
in the case of de@@ fam@@ ation for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse - such as those who commit criminal off@@ ences or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of it is politically and legally sacred .
some of them are still un@@ ej@@ ected and leave questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated ones , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subject of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the residents of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
moreover , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that deeply dealt with the people could not be wa@@ sted even during election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Union and the SPD are increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days there was a high level between the two parties .
only a gar@@ dly dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some of the Interior Minister , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from the double nationality .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he is nothing of a turning away from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ended the discussion in Germany on a temporary basis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to make it new is not meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition he has constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , has yet to show itself .
there &apos;s a lot of things to argue about .
but the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel shows caution at first and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting lightly .
in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures rise worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
on the recall campaign there are vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year with the deliveries .
despite the high number of brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car liner is able to further develop a further plus in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand became weaker predominantly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened its sales as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the domestic market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
brand sales Chief Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it a reluc@@ t@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU was bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman .
in the US , where the gas @-@ gases first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is getting lightly smo@@ ked by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales , Fred Kap@@ pler , continued to show a sales platform from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust gas .
in Germany alone VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the vehicles have been retro@@ fitted , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting the car , the car subscri@@ bed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I don &apos;t speak about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was stated in business circles on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting was held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my research commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place after retro@@ fitting and have unchanged all type @-@ relevant vehicle data unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was mentioned in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that customers , for example , come to a workshop half a year after retro@@ fitting - and that could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste sc@@ andal may result in uncertainty regarding possible warranty rules as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future criminal interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher anks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not have to worry about paying punishment for their austerity sentences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks stock money over night with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.4 percent penalty .
this charge requires Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund back from September by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposit or daily cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost € 400 in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he be@@ ware 40 million euros that could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays the costs now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the banking officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the association of the Gen@@ ossen@@ schafts@@ verband Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to wear it alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank People &apos;s Bank of Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Managing Director of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele which is somewhat lush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and there is a threat to the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers in Germany won &apos;t be able to enjoy this in the l@@ atitude . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dest@@ ination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
before heading to the comment section to aw@@ aken him under the pseud@@ onym of non@@ alle@@ en@@ ant men of middle age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no horror by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional impact : older vendors tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and gra@@ zing wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something determin@@ ant as : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o gradually loses its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic plate speci@@ als .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I received from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , do I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , the walls of his living room dress up .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pupp@@ y , people who heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually got rid of their collection in such a way around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of fans of the record company of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evoke joyful youth memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff fle@@ es from a pile pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ ther by a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead coup@@ é , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come first slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records , has a female audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz sounding out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks odd , but the psych@@ ic trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it makes a more window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of s@@ labs is ... &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to slip into the pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v voted , they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning shopping with a stroll through the Ber@@ wick Street and sheets , while avoiding the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old wrong present@@ er who raises the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects proposal on demoli@@ tion of shops in the refugee camp
a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses in which people within the camp offer goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which carry a risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were absolutely plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than feeding people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the rip @-@ off was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp was increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in new arri@@ vals in the course of summer .
despite Olympic di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time , cycli@@ st Tony Martin isn &apos;t going to get lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and compete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the passage of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace which reasons lead to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the FIFA World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes to Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara Olympic Champion ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

group starts up @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is a giant - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am only started with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch other games while playing , but also intervene yourself .
for example , they can give players up missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is supposed to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ ups , based in Seattle , Washington , Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , like Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
Be@@ am is integrated in the video games department around the Xbox @-@ console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
well @-@ known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was purchased by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the reinforcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new lightning units are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic reinforcement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , on accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary speed limit@@ er for adher@@ ence to speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
reinforcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring mode , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
laser measurement technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access pro@@ hibitions according to time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art move , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
to ensure that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently France has re @-@ ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain scores silver in 7 @-@ year rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class brings gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ he rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji provided a master class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , back @-@ back , line @-@ up and ru@@ sting force in order to gain gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji might have cast a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal round his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago they lost each game under R@@ yan in the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began beautifully and let the attacks cast off G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au beat out in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a h@@ amp@@ ant T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in seventh minute Ath@@ lete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and rus@@ hed down to the line to make a fool .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still being forgotten .
this is how it is .
GB performed basic changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ians whose fans sang , flags sw@@ inging and d@@ anced at the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whist@@ le sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB chi@@ pped crus@@ hing into the lawn .
earlier the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown finished the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton thrust the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than in those games , and that will mean what is called .
from the first ru@@ dder @-@ stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when they were recru@@ ited for the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who laid such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written application , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of trium@@ ph@@ al ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and nobody was an assistant than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he is ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky enough to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break to a minimum , if that is the right concept in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning to talk a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that might be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive Th@@ ank goes to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t get lost during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close up , st@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t prepared to make some T@@ oll@@ es .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , your own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant a lot of pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing clarity for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ eller , retired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ än@@ k@@ ischer Trink@@ wasser@@ schutz@@ verband as a model for the large water producers .
this meant that some time ago in the original on a post by the Bavarian Radio .
little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia honored the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was considered exemplary in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Rupert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , 28 years of which he was Managing Director .
he retired at the age of 65 .
the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , has approximately 150@@ 000 m3 of water each year and provides 32 locations and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Rupert G@@ öller was appointed as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still and there was always new additions , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised her faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water utility association in a real way , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken Water Forum .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Rupert G@@ öller also praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water atten@@ dant and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose @-@ union .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the plum@@ bing at the high tank near Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees we had to work all night , so that the localities could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because one filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who takes over the succession of Rupert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is openly concerned with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the now eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something which lies two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala he recalls nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s combination with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrot@@ t .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots to life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and killed her le@@ thal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man inv@@ oked and told us to have shot his companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly pun@@ ish@@ able .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald head .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information about the ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a child of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special case command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens , threatened by the industry from the promotion of green electricity , are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of the renewable energy environment in the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach the tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate of agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only when the generators in the steel plants are replaced trap an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
the status quo of the current regulation is thus largely determined .
the success of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weigh@@ ed in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation escal@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties show import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is not clear how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ rupp stayed cau@@ ti@@ ously on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at the same time Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was not interested in closing certain works of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers are cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the steel industry shared on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the amount presented now went back for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months , thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly ch@@ oral .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior team .
most senior singers sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , described H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing , to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs become not so fast out of the box in everyday life .
even though it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older people often have a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs ar@@ ouses many memories in older people , often connected with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia fall into long rec@@ eding events .
in addition , when singing , a special performance is required to the head , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone are not only concentrating on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in a choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who list@@ ens when a tone goes next to it ?
in search of the right offer sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a sen@@ iors ench@@ y@@ ma , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader .
you can also find many sen@@ iors over the internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with internet research .
those who want to sing , should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers at scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the rep@@ airing of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the m@@ owing also didn &apos;t let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of cat bab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to le@@ es of k@@ itt@@ ens , who choose to find themselves in great distress , as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out .
cr@@ aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of little ones , taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who still have no offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ation of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males had re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ uses with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ wa@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former foot@@ ball@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ pper in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ eling of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency arrived after a fall attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of ordinary citizens , was not to be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is held responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , even before the football is stopped .
the prosec@@ utor also issued an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ consu@@ l .
accordingly , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kern@@ r is to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
it is true that the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact that on the life of most Turks , however , does not have any effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an ended on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ lic@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will especially come back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season demonstrates his sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory finale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also leave early in the European League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it reached sixth place .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season @-@ figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ till@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez l@@ ent to the AC Florence under the agreement and on Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as was announced after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to do so , the stri@@ ker should be willing to for@@ ego roughly a third of his annual salary to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must@@ n &apos;t start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theme is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock brief@@ ed their start right before the games , was raff@@ led out mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) and rested .
it was a bizarre scene : with a raised smile she was still st@@ alled in the hall and provoked her performance .
when she found out that she wasn &apos;t going to catch gold , the audience rus@@ hed out into a rush @-@ storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men , who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion is even faster than ever before , with more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the drug Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had strong too@@ th@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion in 2013 and European Championship , has been positively tested for the forbidden stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was blocked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the big fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion more than 400 m , was positive tested in 2010 and was locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , em@@ eu@@ red Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ sti@@ el , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after establishing testosterone dop@@ ing in him .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Tribunal .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is at rank 2 of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record winner and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive until May , but can still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mil@@ der and ran off on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital but had already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a b@@ room .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early , two explo@@ sives came up again , another person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
the det@@ onation near the beach in Pat@@ ong , which was popular with holi@@ day@@ makers , was injured by a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called for several wounded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south east coast .
there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ents carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just a local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta have been laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have received secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they were not informed about the exact time and locations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group lies behind the attacks .
the police ordered their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are again and again smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities on his homepage .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
j@@ un@@ ta head and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , with@@ drew itself to have the kingdom restored to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
over 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop by a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the constitutional guards in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East become extrem@@ ist .
that is why we now observe the movement too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she addresses &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional guards in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities when making a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts in general try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with Pop music .
that would mean Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently , there have been reports of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ aß said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the significant increase in legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it can be quite clear that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups form , plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned vo@@ iced concerns that many transgres@@ sions went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is wor@@ rying .
many of the suspect in attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated perpetr@@ ators or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , have radically changed by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sen@@ timent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics centre the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it temporarily could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ its became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
as most athletes run in Ethiopia , cov@@ eted just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media reported it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b of the W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the British tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ vel@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to start alone in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ vel@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp no longer sees the im@@ pending election defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president Donald Tru@@ mp has already been an Altern@@ ati@@ vide@@ e .
he then went on vacation .
if Donald Tru@@ mp is losing the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party more and more resistance was formed .
post is increasing in the trade with electric vehicles
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell her electric car Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post will also be offering its electric vehicles on the free car market from next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to embar@@ k on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether they will be delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be delivered to other companies .
post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always ques@@ tioning , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in the post @-@ production plant .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP tour starts after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the cuts came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research group Gf@@ K showed that the chair by CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research group Gf@@ K : following again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the worldwide number five is facing a new beginning .
GF@@ RP Executive Board plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Grin@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
as early as September 1 , the management of the Executive Board took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ erk@@ inger , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; board spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differing views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who will be leading the market research company in the future is still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles it was said that Friday , with the shareholders , was last the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings initiated in years ago .
since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been working on the Gf@@ K summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder at some point becomes rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; if this were the case with BMW , this would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company did not have the opportunity to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in relation to the first half @-@ year , sales rose by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the company &apos;s s@@ unken value was bur@@ dened by the profit in the second quarter .
the company acquisition of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience division , which has become necessary in the Consumer Experience division , has a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into cru@@ mbs in pits : eight wounded
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade a vice that was partly on the counter track .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ance ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ told travellers were brought back from a bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ court district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of 1 October 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of waste water amount to 3.@@ 44 euro instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after an excessive calculation , the wastewater fee in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the household was approved by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach department store , it was established that under@@ cover works for these sewage installations .
due to legal bases , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ effective manner .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ ig@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee , a new calculation of fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be compensated .
the severe fee increases were based on the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small , with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect .
moreover , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ated calculation period of all three plants , renovation and repair expenses were not least due to the age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair costs .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage system Az@@ endorf because of damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and at the pond sewage plant L@@ opp , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came to the ongoing care and maintenance costs which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that during the low waste water intake in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance were fully exploited . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the waste water systems , has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal se@@ wer@@ age association could not be extended by these facilities because they are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria registers for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a rise of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its Filter@@ tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s paintings .
the filters are non @-@ blo@@ ated , self @-@ locking tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all abor@@ tions reach the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting black face promotions or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them s@@ lot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled this feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism rec@@ alled the filter to inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely distributed over the photos , that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to be unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluc@@ tant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yel@@ low@@ ish face has been pulled into the throwing extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per Star .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration fight , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are different than their older counter@@ parts in terms of race - could assume more of the ability to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that racial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the partially white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a staff responsible to concentrate on under@@ represented sections of the population and to internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will keep her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a report on Thursday in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Dis@@ pute , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and the Wehrmacht , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence collected by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders typically recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism when it allowed actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ com range from the top to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts face pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , Stat@@ ements and Stat@@ ements prior to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; the report stated .
for example , a Cent@@ Com officer publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Shi@@ p , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the mor@@ ale among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. ship and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported on the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , announced in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the contents of the Islamic State reminds of divisions of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these Pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ nation commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative for his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win a fourth match in the women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK is on hand
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember this ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who are defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams .
the first placed will be a little longer to the strong Dutch , who lead the other group .
as always the game ends on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising f@@ uss because of their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of a ho@@ ckey club in his hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years , she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became the coach of the national team and thus the things started to get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to completely s@@ nat@@ ch the helm .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand cut .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she ran a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to get the female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the Tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could well have been among those known names sent to Prime Time , based on sponsors and feel @-@ good TV commerci@@ als if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule long .
but if I should rather make arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw your attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many of the people I had questioned didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 , an ath@@ lete , who has made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only a motivated enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never ending up - but also the grace of turning and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to version , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to continue in their quest for gold further , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and down , up and down at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transmission also another impressive goal : the world or the Olympi@@ apark .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir one spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel somewhat tired of looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the bottom of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she jumps , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner proposed recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed while clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a thorough investigation now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror against the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia has been anything but an example of democracy , human rights organisations have perpet@@ u@@ ated the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and do not have any other options other than protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ ab Tes@@ home , a tut@@ or in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which in recent years have been forced more or less to utilize the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of inf@@ low under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ian people have been able to communicate via social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and improved Internet services .
even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians declared that they were thus gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from eth@@ ni@@ cities predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a guide of Oro@@ sei . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is equally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was over 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 .
he was considered tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special mand@@ ates to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic fate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons in order to take over the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North @-@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting that , according to the information provided by analysts , were seemingly fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ hard city , triggered by Tig@@ ray &apos;s business and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains Obama &apos;s claim to have founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , attacking his repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication revealed new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate country , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings its comrades , who endeav@@ our to take care of it during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant .
after making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp def@@ enced the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he cri@@ tically critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I thought it was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one language barriers in politics and then ret@@ ard them as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert observing the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp adopted an even more corro@@ bor@@ ate tone as his survey values declined further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a great advance in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr Tru@@ mp is generally trying to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humor .
but while rein@@ forcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent people , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he is saying are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned by Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back benches , completely wrong , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ can try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and repro@@ ached them to travel on each of his words and to be pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s excuse as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the President &apos;s Office .
once displaced by the price of the market , Café comes back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which was not a Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s shop , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ile wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel Exclu@@ ded and Ver@@ b is a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when New York is changing , it is also new inv@@ ocation .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained many things .
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hing like cap@@ ers and sau@@ te onions .
there are natural cycles .
the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client recently on a Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the club .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coffee drinking , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pick@@ pocket and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
now Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his everyday ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that the soap business had taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will deal with it yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tended to leave her soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets President Roosev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Bri@@ ck@@ man tells in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the perspective of a food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ ek snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a cheap ingredient that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ in @-@ can buffet .
men &apos;s teams cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who during the First World War sent food to hungry Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the ways in which the country was going to no longer be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se theme for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were stap@@ led into stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food residue , &quot; she noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
peculiar mixes have been tried out because a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing gr@@ ati@@ fication takes preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement at mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before , or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - assumed the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping women &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ light like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
particularly tasty are the reports on the government response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake food posture .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million @-@ million man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly real@@ istically alien .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hypo@@ thesis of a house@@ keeper with no interest in fla@@ vor@@ ings by Ms Roosev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as on how science was applied to food .
at the writing of the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
after the plates arrived at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e came out to produce a dessert that they had cooked at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roosev@@ elt did eat at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a common trick to miss a modest recipe with modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ ved somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
aston@@ ish@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took a break three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil defence group that according to Bild @-@ Zeitung saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives at the game in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil servant pointing him out of the rub@@ ble of a house during a 11 @-@ hour rescue , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining icon in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs across the AD district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
after an examination on board the research vessel S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland is only 150 years old .
lei@@ surely , the Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k is floating along the north Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it counts , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lon@@ el@@ iness of life , however , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already gu@@ essed that Greenland will become st@@ ony .
only the evidence lack@@ ed .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they often appear in the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her slow @-@ tur@@ pent@@ ine measured her , when she lod@@ ged six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , these sh@@ arks still make the loo@@ t : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland H@@ arks , who managed to catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest measure was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
in order to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a notably high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapon tests po@@ unded greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
the len@@ tic@@ ular , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , which should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major land@@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was showing an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers could even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks can obviously have at least one and a half centuries time with the multip@@ lication .
this should also be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al problems live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
the old record holder , a 211 years old Greenland whale , in whose sp@@ eck on the neck reached a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in a double pack
the municipal council has focused on topics related to construction in the latest session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the Board accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the commerci@@ alization of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on surve@@ ying , the sale of land in the residential areas of &quot; Street Line &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction Section 1 ) is nothing more in the way .
the municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building wil@@ lows can register in the town hall right away . the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session on the allocation of the plots .
in order to be able to meet also requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to am@@ end the newly created land use plan in sub @-@ domains only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Lower @-@ Tim@@ et@@ lar@@ n the industrial area already proven there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main thus has the best chances to attract reloc@@ ated jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission is given to them in the UK so far .
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such is the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk category ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but also cuts down the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city features easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Merc@@ er , the city stands on No. 7 , Luxembourg , No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry by the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead gains legal costs from hepatitis C Patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Jud@@ ge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is eligible for ref@@ unding legal costs resulting from H@@ ep@@ atic C law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
in surve@@ ying the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. magi@@ str@@ ate Beth @-@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other and took possession of laboratory work entitled Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ le , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops backed by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the US supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned it , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday .
according to the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently recru@@ iting the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians , who were held captive by the fighters as host@@ ages , Shar@@ af@@ j Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters joined the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are working clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve € 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton published her tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton reached almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ ars ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term of office in the State Department .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declarations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers designated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections were not complete .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to answer funds , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already top@@ pled on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday to publish his tax return in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp .
on Thursday she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp paid no or very little tax , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday which stated that this could still be the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure that individuals who pay more than USD 1 million make a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha last week , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tru@@ mp at a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check by the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , average an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 Clin@@ tons &apos;s tax declaration showed that only USD 100 of its income paid as a reward , unlike most Americans .
its main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , out of which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , intensified its funding by practi@@ sing volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , while they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ ly cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a hint is usually already enough to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last possibility is a thro@@ wer that shoots a gold fire@@ works in the air and thereby causes a loud , bright explosion .
city council decides unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk next to St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of commercial traders take up with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly out@@ dated .
the city council now , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sales office on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine river which was under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not suit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election , since Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann sought to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s list of votes .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel by its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have &quot; given &quot; the alleged Arabic guests &quot; demands . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly proved all accus@@ ations of herself and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not include in the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber floors against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber floors against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to install rubber shells and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the demonstr@@ ators saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the preliminary President Michel Tim@@ er spra@@ yed on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators in masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian enterprises on business in the country grew sharply , the ambassador said .
Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports grew by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia for this year .
last year , the Russian representation came from around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily to travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia broke out last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , which have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : beverage market in forest br@@ oth survi@@ ves
on Thursday evening a rob@@ ber@@ y fell on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a fire@@ arm three dark dressed people who had embra@@ ced their faces demanded the release of cash from the staff of the drink market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the Re@@ we market &apos;s park deck .
after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators need to be cleared in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking place located in front of the parking house with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 hrs ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young@@ sters of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection agency Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leisure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leisure center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ ven &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to Bohemia with the visit of the stro@@ be zoo .
on the other hand , Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third ou@@ ting took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group gathered at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash .
culinary was spoiled by children and care@@ gi@@ vers with their self @-@ prepared dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and t@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was stained , beautiful jewels created from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were overcome .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers in presumably two years , the Mini@@ steri@@ al Round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Bischof@@ s@@ stadt Freiburg , where , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the holy place , went their way .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and blessed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b he went by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster de@@ arly beloved wife is standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s way from Münster was started .
the single day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a brief impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is , at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches , made a stop again and again to sing a song from a specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
the local par@@ ishes were par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes for the nights .
at the stage targets Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and also star@@ chy supp@@ er and the breakfast .
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day later , one stepped into the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to first desc@@ ended at some 500 al@@ timet@@ ers at low heat and then climbed again afterwards .
in the evening , the deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathroom .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the closing stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
the Min@@ is of Co @-@ operator Markus O@@ bert , who arrived on the pilgrimage destination , were welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes back home , as Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ länder Call@@ um Sk@@ inner went last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y made his own .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the rail world champion@@ ships in London despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner set an Olympic record in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ du was slightly behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which hin@@ der went up in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der said that after a weak start he deliberately dropped on the train .
he later with@@ drew this statement , and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined together as a team in the last three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeat Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in one competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day were also born Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won Gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he had disputed himself with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e , advanced in a world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , such as Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s res@@ ignation in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing repro@@ aches , as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melting shop of Port@@ land due to the lifting of energy demand
the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company shared .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to assign any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a grant that has been established for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melt , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land is losing money and ris@@ king a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L believes that the contracts in financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L admitted that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its yearly closing in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa insist@@ ed that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to ensure the supply to the melt is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration of why it has withdrawn from the contract .
based on the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year and around 900 MW of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ h of reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the Vog@@ ue &apos;s September issue
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an clan , C@@ lans Kr@@ is , is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September issue of the U.S. Vog@@ ue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans alike ? ) , well @-@ filled reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d action of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a transmitting site at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
she likes her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most popular edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to fashion@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the article 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin have been le@@ aked even before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Prize winner and CEO J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover for 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break @-@ down model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of its generation - falls under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is related to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; the Mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings appeared again high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but going around on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the Vog@@ ue &apos;s September issue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from Est@@ ée Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell pictures of them on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures made by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centres annually show 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are annually rejected by the community centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mi@@ tig@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ aying and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already fully utilized , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of the Territ@@ orial Centr@@ es of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Commun@@ al Research Centr@@ es resulted in the rejection of thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without any repe@@ al of the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people from important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave non@@ violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need will be forced from Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Ministers and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these middle @-@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n accused of employing weapons allegedly gun
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that in February , the campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a fire@@ arm on a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i admitted that the matter would be internally regulated before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; moved a pist@@ ol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and conf@@ isc@@ ated the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ fe , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment .
after compl@@ aining with the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that already at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he announced in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and arms @-@ friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges were to appoint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
on calls to his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , was not responding .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U governing party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely rule in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head up the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD top@@ pled from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in parliament .
despite moderate losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag at 3 percent respectively .
according to the survey , the SPD candidate for the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were still smiling behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates , on the other hand , would not miss the entrance in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market .
the followers are domin@@ ating the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the stores exactly 20 years ago , 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months ago at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers , albeit slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market is domin@@ ating the market today , which all came much later than Nokia .
to be online anytime , anywhere , this is everyday for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion units were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 5@@ 55 million of them .
worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
an entire industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
she eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today every German looks at his mobile 88 times per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to take the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel at the Siemens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Siemens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies in the vicinity of He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , creating 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the two sailors were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on economic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and across the United Kingdom .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most popular cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion for private investment .
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the He@@ a@@ throw extension will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and occupation that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of ad blocking &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; are the same .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding for his adver@@ ts to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of which portion of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the inviting Open Source Community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying signs of display have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue streams .
the company has said it on desktop PCs since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over the adverti@@ sed advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook maintained that Ad@@ block would cause new filters to be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a stum@@ ble means , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman at presum@@ able suicide on Swiss highway crossing
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday over@@ came a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; in the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ powered by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who asked them , as well as every witness of the incident , to report .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after passing a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , was probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model has been designed to determine whether Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still rot@@ ated slowly .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably indicated more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus expon@@ enti@@ ally ex@@ poses its daily aspect of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , some degree cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that had previously been suspected by planets .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years .
their oceans were evapor@@ ating and their water vap@@ or was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , the way we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations on Thursday and led to low co @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy said in a statement .
in the course of summer , I have thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this requires it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organisation .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams award .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the two last years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference in five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy got four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles relating to wages for North Sea oil workers will be suspended , while all the parties campaig@@ ning for a new round of talks to the table said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been conducted spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of processing the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its refl@@ ectors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s install@@ ment follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament members , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler recognis@@ es the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods with the planet origin stand .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood now .
they are now rotating the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler recognis@@ es the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more mas@@ si@@ fy stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereas larger stars are rotating more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot to us about how we want to learn more about how , when and why stars are slow@@ ing down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak up their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emo@@ tionally res@@ ignation , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participant announced the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the year on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back up with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded in the Hall of Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star assigned to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a ster@@ oid banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect for years to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done a favour in 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench often .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , &quot; added Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson are said to be the sympath@@ ies of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ van@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an ath@@ omed ath@@ lete could have won almost one medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and ruled out - immediately before the very beginning of the critical athle@@ tics competitions this news comes to an end .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old won the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have been able to take part in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and calls for full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news in@@ filtr@@ ated the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was preliminary suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ specimen was also positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately announced his criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Board had prohibited the entire Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the nation nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous ver@@ sts in China also had cat@@ ered for fierce disputes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a debate with Australia &apos;s M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positive for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .
data lau : as per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware replacement .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ mail ran@@ som falls significantly higher than at home users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the drawing programs were still designed to send advertisement .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for itself .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past months , terri@@ fying quickly .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it sel@@ ectively searches for un@@ modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the requirements of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage falls when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies affected reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt business operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany there have already been several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of patient records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the perpetr@@ ators &apos; demand in the face of stand@@ still .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay using Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support web sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t example files for free .
and are private individuals rede@@ em@@ ing after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must in part negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware of about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers sell their malicious software in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware @-@ Kits were developed by purchasing the malware by yourself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ a sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that better ensure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back@@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful performance , the perpetr@@ ators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things to the grain in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference of Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heat could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling slightly .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l for til@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is yet another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( working until tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when maneu@@ vering .
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles if necessary the speed .
however , full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline does not stick : crash on passenger bridge
an airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is only conceivable for the dangers that are typical for aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee @-@ iron in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline did not have to pay any damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
after their trip , people with diabetes get back money if the cause of the disease is doubt@@ ful in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was severely affected by diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ rets .
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a corrupt sewage treatment plant , which pur@@ port@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip had been defici@@ ent - and was compl@@ aining about the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only heard about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the water samples .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the atro@@ cities committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must react and act decisi@@ vely at the same time on terror threats .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders have to leave the country more quickly , however , this hei@@ gh@@ tens security and strength as well as the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ fourth magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism should again be under penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance has been designed to improve weapons law in such a way that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is difficult .
the most recently discussed obligation for sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be kept in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , how the endanger@@ ing of the citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister considers better social care necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly spoke against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , which he considers to be un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t ban all that is bor@@ rowed , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Simone Peter designed the minister to em@@ ulate Tat@@ ar and his ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and tigh@@ tening the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
improved traffic flow on the motorway network
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the legal agreement is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway crossing ( A 43 ) .
on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) , road construction will be extended in the area between the Hammer road and the leaving Wes@@ er Straße in the right @-@ hand lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then jump right from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the transport spl@@ its up early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district of the District of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys mot@@ ori@@ sts between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ go path and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the con@@ i@@ fer on the B 51 shortly before the exit W@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is ste@@ ered only one @-@ lane through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back more than three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to absorb heavy @-@ load traffic .
the state @-@ owned company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated daily traffic jam will last .
however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal agreement , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it was to be reck@@ oned with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday in one lane at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Youth Theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project .
most young people in the class had come to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Youth Theatre Münster .
the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ ys , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language placement are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increasing number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for better weather
the weather has made the star@@ ve snow@@ s in the south west of Germany a stroke through the bill on Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seemingly come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning is far from the wake ring @-@ ring@@ ing no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes for them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Beauty and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ing and sleeping disorder .
when sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the Board of the German Acade@@ mic Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are subject to each other .
those who , for example , have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to pon@@ der on everyday problems and worries , gives you an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised during the day , you should go to the doctor advises .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , tired , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any lower sleeping medicine available in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , if you have problems with sleeping problems , you should contact the family doctor .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for examining in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing phrases , in case of sickness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping ends .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
it counts : regular sleeping and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to offer with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us via Facebook .
in December 2014 he had brought gold for the first time at the World Cup Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues in the critical review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € , nobody should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming pool is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate dop@@ ing as closely as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ et would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Speci@@ es arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil investig@@ ators of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had made several pocket and luggage pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past thi@@ eves .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July this year , and they had a common , rigid and professional approach .
the Speci@@ alists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat Law 34 can prove four acts to the Di@@ vers , who entered Germany exclusively for the off@@ ence of crimes .
in doing so , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lines of lime , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like that , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , passing play@@ grounds , a rev@@ amped kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
at the front of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; ! &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshafen , are however preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , however , on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin in@@ ator handle has expressed itself several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the building workers renovated the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers stri@@ pped under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late L@@ ate .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children here , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted mostly police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors make up , evi@@ dently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Riga D@@ ome .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under a large police officer in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the R@@ ī@@ ga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ liners from all over the world : residents of GDR times and former home owners share their Kie@@ z with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by ri@@ pen@@ ed windows or freshly painted faç@@ ades that have been thrown out with bags of paint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned so often this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences constitute material damage which tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the R@@ ī@@ ga anymore .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to the Riga Street - and stayed .
that is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of a sudden claimed the interpretation of the city .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that forced the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here people prefer people who are not so well searched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never stops listening ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin has little understanding for zo@@ oms that are angry with paint bombs : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who puts into a pub area , can complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new commission@@ er for refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all stakeholders : refugees , working groups , refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the cutting @-@ edge wool milk , which above all has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cking but rather focuss@@ ing on the multitude of desirable tasks - meant that administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a cutting @-@ edge rug of wool .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has a 50 @-@ percent stake for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers are soon to be found in the Was@@ en@@ strasse
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized for some time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Federal Council to the Municip@@ ality and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it doesn &apos;t work , so be dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments need to be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments is it not done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the key , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be gro@@ unded or furnished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but work does not just mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it takes offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus , administration and volunteers also jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can take time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who at some point develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach , could not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems , too , says customer tru@@ th@@ fully , &quot; people who don &apos;t have anything at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alization after the recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the kill@@ ers will bring them completely into ob@@ itu@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers will have to look for activities locally and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics are afraid .
it is actually unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach are already at full capacity to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
