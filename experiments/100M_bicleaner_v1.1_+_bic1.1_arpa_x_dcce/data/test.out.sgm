<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the World Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: "golden World Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to the feed troughs in fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the system of the ALFA, on a horse he did not even shoot for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German sports aid delivered the Golden Sport pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are no awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel blatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two U.S. presidential candidates are in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively go back to regulations, and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the contrary, says: the state has certain tasks to accomplish, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which it has to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical partisan wing of the Republicans strictly.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be no partisan discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the U.S. again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate protection treaty wants to cancel it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "by contrast, with its investment programme, Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies and demands:" "" "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the United States do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, asking for instance Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 USD is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must arise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics regard him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every escaped woman experiences sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby who is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one talks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria, and she deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodation for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs established the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich-based women's help.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has long been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," she says.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "women outweigh other reasons for flight:" "" "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, patronage, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>

<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "the fact that tugs are demanding sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, Irish, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused in worst cases.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich-based Northern states are traumatized, they appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia there is no such thing in accommodations of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia women are not separated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed decent and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - a whole five times according to a report." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved as if something had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustained cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin testified and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger, as it was done by a presumed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the Vetourites again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The allegations were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse by President Erdoğan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been detained almost to his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey severely - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian import was allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry to the West because its response to the attempted takeover of power is regarded as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the persistent resentment of the snail empathy of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus that after the attempted coup d'etat, he called for support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glamorous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel ill-treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents were saying that they hadn't even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided responding to a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey abruptly pushed the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least speak again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fired staff of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's tightest confidence for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it reads that Putin ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it is (in Russian) that he later was the chief executive and chief of staff of the government caregiver.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man, who once was touted as a potential president, would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to put your trust in a job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term in office, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term had violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of Queensi crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling fans" "", "which are nearing completion to each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today made a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering masterpiece of a truly epic achievement in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of the deck is getting a seat for the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the future-oriented high and low-rise building.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck situated in the expansion, we had to close the existing gap on the northern or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern towing bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the Viadukt is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances on which the team works were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens think: investors are expected to be much stronger in the future." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "concept of action" "" "to the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But the argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should really build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be used as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The great controversy in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such surfaces to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new urban housing support programme that will cost millions and must still be financed will provide incentives for incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is no agreement between the political groups at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few precepts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of that, as Bratmann, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not entirely new: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how to compensate for the loss of further around 1300 low-priced homes, whose support will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, such as the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought-out bonds from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of recovering the apartments back into price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west city, deadlines start at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not mean the owners, the housing corporations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, it is removed from the aim of the so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social-poor in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their spare time on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and lastly confined to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many popculture phenomena, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation playing the game when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person returns every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35,000 users, recently announced the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent jumped to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees raw data for increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes of time" "" "to come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look awful." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mural players who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What shall it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="8">Definitely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast kicked on Thursday for a multi-campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles sculpts on the floating beam during the solo campaign for women in the artistic gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American winning a multi-campaign title and in total the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Billy won the last three years her sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises which include a mixture of ambition and precision, that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected her last examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver each in the solo arena of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Billion took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired man co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned to have the future planned, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which included her typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym, in which Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since summer 2013 she hasn't lost a competition competition any more, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was slightly led by two rotations, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beams and floor-teeth - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She again got up with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still sat on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her dedergust - a pure form of formality - and tears flowed on billowing shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Oma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she cast a comeback to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine at the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicon, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one female female female was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiawarin and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymtikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold in an individual campaign for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see gymnastics across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all beating the same way as Aly and Madison in order to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four players in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and is primarily involved in private trainers, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turners and families). the list can be continued as desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the churches uncountable young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy to access exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gymnastic foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have offered free and affordable floors in Harlem for over 15,000 young people (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" through the holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks, you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance physicians who voted in a vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS had found itself in a "No Man's Land" and would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance physicians should receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend packages to improve maintenance at irregular times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistance Physicians distributed last night in a communication with: "assistance physicians have still serious concerns regarding the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce and administer it to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>

<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out additional work campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a surge of almost 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were consulted to cover doctors on the strikpost chain.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form bellows.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons already having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating governance report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former member of the cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an Antinous King, said that intimidation by voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elective cabs to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He suggests that voters should have a card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter has to name only his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to put removable ink on the finger of a person if they give up their votes in order to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this not only serves against electoral fraud, but should also protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud which is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered from Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's Choice Vals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court ruled that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical fashion" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which a person elects someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly alarming with the fraudulent selection of letters - in the case of the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guidance of wise men to prove their identity.</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with pakistani or bangladan backgrounds.</seg>

<seg id="22">Sir Eric recommended 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists will process letter indiscriminately to stop "election harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is considered by Theresa May, demands also tougher registration dossiers to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social welfare purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your identity card.</seg>

<seg id="7">Hit him with his knees in the chest and twist as the attacker crows out of pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as they set the weapon on him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright cheeks for a guide his tongue on the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test by breaking down some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his train on a Euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prior to the checkup of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of rejecting the flushing button of a migrating toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the support of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he wanted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public joints to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task set his immune system definitively below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test painting showed a luminometric figure of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to refuse, after their luminaries were over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I've cleared in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vukesmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming, which concluded that we said" "" "Lass to call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian on it, kindle it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her apartment after a delogiation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelby and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative's employees found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were paving holes, wooden planks were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was a nightmare for the people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family agreed to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as delaying is always the final step considering the Cornwall housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and had to look terrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to establish a disciplinary committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes face the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro confusion.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer to her home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary revealed that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine test under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotisans in the Olympic village.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader Kenias by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to enforce their own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IOC, the IAAF will evaluate the assessment," stated in an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotisch, handed over the rehearsal and signed," explained Kenyas Head de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become a world champion in Peking in 2015 over 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics delegate Michael Rotisch had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country about pending doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping associations for quite some time.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls presented by the IOC in front of the Rio Games, it was uncommon to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA Kenya occupied Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control was compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports by the ARD, there have been repeatedly allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports cheating.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he was employed in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thereby it was possible to demonstrate that in this sport type was surface-wide and systematically looped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid as yet it's not going to be: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most vacationers, who are in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so may not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, disperse flyers and pick up voices at the end, only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let go of an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's all about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end coalitionable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a bit with the people, just as his legendary singer Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise seafarers have got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossoming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We are creating that" "" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, Lorenz Caffier, the Minister of the Interior, has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes the right place for election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Angela Merkel to open meetings for Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's parliamentary group is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority from other states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was recently published in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a shame not to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU will largely abandon the usual election campaigns on market places and before shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, that means Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country, it is unleashing the basis that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the vast expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "however, the Council of the CDU-campaigner Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing:" "" "they must go where it hurt, namely where people are: village festivals, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the S & D Group recently complained 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD gained a clear victory with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and largely transfer their election campaign to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="34">Otherwise green ballots embark on a search for traces of local vocal chords among holidaymakers.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-refurbishment: catering facilities suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8pm, there are praise everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commencement of those responsible for the construction works is also vowed, for example when it comes to the establishment of airport journeys.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was andered on Monday to the south and the locking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is again there, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic passes through the town seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some serious complaints," says the assistant director Florian King responsible for the relocation engineering of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachwerstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many crevices were looking for and rather familiar with their Navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were frantic.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the community increasingly requested the sensing vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable excesses," says King, who made himself clear about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute baked.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakthroughs allows anyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "who has less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. produced for other companies, has hardly any consequences for the renovation." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "maximum slight drop" "", "but also clears that of course" "" "the running message is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most strongly exploited are the streets along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds considerable words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants were" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "it increases sales revenue to" "" "far more than 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the roadside renovation has been" "" "thrown back for two years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the advice given that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it points to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars are now less frequented due to the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it is also very nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his pedigree comes back after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 works on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, which is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before heading to the comment section to awaken him under the pseudonym of nonalleenant men of middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horror by hobbyists - it has an emotional impact: older vendors tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and grazing wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something determinant as: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho gradually loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I received from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, do I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), the walls of his living room dress up.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was a little too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media puppy, people who heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection in such a way around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of fans of the record company of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke joyful youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" "" "a staff flees from a pile pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smother by a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead coupé, so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-like.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a turntable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come first slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a female audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz sounding out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but the psychic trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a more window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of slabs is... "it casts off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to slip into the pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "disk art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov voted, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning shopping with a stroll through the Berwick Street and sheets, while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong presenter who raises the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses in which people within the camp offer goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which carry a risk of fire and health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais" "" "were absolutely plausible." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the rip-off was the Jungle Book Kids "Café of the camp, which is charitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp was increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in new arrivals in the course of summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed measurer: in various federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning units are tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic reinforcement trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, on accident areas, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary speed limiter for adherence to speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reinforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measuring mode, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access prohibitions according to time, travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the state-of-the-art move, the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="10">To ensure that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and incidentally also sweat-proof outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even foreign authorities are flashing with the new technology: recently France has re-ordered 100 copies, after an order of 150 pieces last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-he rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the fijis when they were struck with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji provided a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, back-back, line-up and rusting force in order to gain gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji might have cast a 15-man-team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal round his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost each game under Ryan in the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began beautifully and let the attacks cast off GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau beat out in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hampant Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In seventh minute Athlete Jasa Veremalua left a Touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new beginning and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and rushed down to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still being forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB performed basic changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinsulians whose fans sang, flags swinging and danced at the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliam put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis embraced and GB chipped crushing into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown finished the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton thrust the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than in those games, and that will mean what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder-stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when they were recruited for the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter unwritten application, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of triumphal geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing, there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that make the difference and nobody was an assistant than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky enough to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the break to a minimum, if that is the right concept in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, threatened by the industry from the promotion of green electricity, are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the liberation of the renewable energy environment in the existing plants for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach the tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a certificate of agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel plants are replaced trap an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The status quo of the current regulation is thus largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">The success of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation escalated when the world's largest producer of China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has a little relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties show import steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp stayed cautiously on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time ThyssenKrupp was not interested in closing certain works of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers are cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the steel industry shared on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the amount presented now went back for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an increase in orders in the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choral.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "sing me - emotional and physical," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior team.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior singers sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, described Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speaking and organizing, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs become not so fast out of the box in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it's about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "older people often have a very special effect," "" "says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens Organisations." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs arouses many memories in older people, often connected with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia fall into long receding events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, when singing, a special performance is required to the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone are not only concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing through singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens when a tone goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors enchyma, one can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many seniors over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="7">At the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a broom.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday early, two explosives came up again, another person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">The detonation near the beach in Patong, which was popular with holidaymakers, was injured by a taxi driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded which killed a city clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Revier of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, several detonations in Phang Nga and Trang called for several wounded in Phang Nga and Trang on the south west coast as well as in Chumphon at the south east coast.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is just a local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>

<seg id="26">In Thailand there are again and again smaller bomb attacks, but they are mostly not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta head and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody riots, withdrew itself to have the kingdom restored to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">Over 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period can also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The severe fee increases were based on the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small, with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of Roy Lichtenstein's paintings.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-bloated, self-locking tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All abortions reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of promoting black face promotions or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowish face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled this feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature from Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter to injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely distributed over the photos, that the filter was" "" "hurtful and" "" "said to be unpleasant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellowish face has been pulled into the throwing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolper Star.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration fight, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are different than their older counterparts in terms of race - could assume more of the ability to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed when it was the case," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the partially white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence intelligence, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a report on Thursday in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committee of Dispute, Secret Service Committees and the Wehrmacht, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence collected by high-level Centcom commanders typically recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism when it allowed actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," "" "a newspaper article quoted the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in the Centcom range from the top to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts face pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, Statements and Statements prior to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts," the report stated.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom officer publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tips of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Ship, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed the morale among analysts and" "" "gave too little space for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. ship and the Democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported on the Pentagon's General Inspector who received complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, announced in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the contents of the Islamic State reminds of divisions of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year the team around Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these Provisional refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's damnation commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are consistent and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the wristwatch to the swimmers to the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well have been among those known names sent to Prime Time, based on sponsors and feel-good TV commercials if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should rather make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw your attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on trampolines has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely perceived that many of the people I had questioned didn't know that it was an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on trampolines and until 2012, an athlete, who has made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only a motivated enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never ending up - but also the grace of turning and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to version, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to continue in their quest for gold further, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and down, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transmission also another impressive goal: the world or the Olympiapark.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir one spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel somewhat tired of looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The bottom of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumps, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner proposed recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed while clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a thorough investigation now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror against the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia has been anything but an example of democracy, human rights organisations have perpetuated the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and do not have any other options other than protest, it breaks out," "" "said Sejab Teshome, a tutor in central ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years have been forced more or less to utilize the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of inflow under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopian people have been able to communicate via social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and improved Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians declared that they were thus gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orosei and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orosei and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, which come from ethnicities predominantly Christian high-countries, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a guide of Orosei." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is equally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was over 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special mandates to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic fate," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons in order to take over the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North-Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005 after thousands of elections were protesting that, according to the information provided by analysts, were seemingly fuelled by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amhard city, triggered by Tigray's business and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights on neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim to have founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, attacking his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification revealed new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate country, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its comrades, who endeavour to take care of it during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump defenced the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he critically criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course, I thought it was sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone language barriers in politics and then retard them as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump adopted an even more corroborate tone as his survey values declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a great advance in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr Trump is generally trying to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while reinforcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent people, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he is saying are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned by Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back benches, completely wrong, and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republican try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and reproached them to travel on each of his words and to be prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he defied the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You cannot!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps excuse as only a further proof that he was unsuitable for the President's Office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest cyclone is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an examination on board the research vessel Sanna, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland is only 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Grönland-shark is floating along the north Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This loneliness of life, however, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at least one Grönlandshark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "said Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionary biologist already guessed that Greenland will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence lacked.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live above all in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they often appear in the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-turpentine measured her, when she lodged six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, these sharks still make the loot: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver, which torches from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland Harks, who managed to catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest measure was 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a notably high carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapon tests pounded greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">The lenticular, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, with a length of 220 centimetres, which should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major landsharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock was showing an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland, while the record shark with 502 centimeters could even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-sharks can obviously have at least one and a half centuries time with the multiplication.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusal problems live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The old record holder, a 211 years old Greenland whale, in whose speck on the neck reached a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran, the interest in Russian enterprises on business in the country grew sharply, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, further commercial exploitation is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports grew by 91.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch, St. Anna, were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were overcome.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers in presumably two years, the Ministerial Round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Bischofsstadt Freiburg, where, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy at Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the holy place, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and blessed the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he went by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster dearly beloved wife is standing and so the Pilgrim's way from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The single day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a brief impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis, at field crosses, chapels or churches, made a stop again and again to sing a song from a specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The local parishes were parishioners of the local parishes for the nights.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage targets Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and also starchy supper and the breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day later, one stepped into the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to first descended at some 500 altimeters at low heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the evening, the deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis of Co-operator Markus Obert, who arrived on the pilgrimage destination, were welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottländer Callum Skinner went last night in the men's team Sprint in Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy made his own.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the rail world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu was slightly behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which hinder went up in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," "" "It's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hinder said that after a weak start he deliberately dropped on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement, and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindu said," "" "It feels like London with all the UK flags." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to get back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeat Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sport; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hindu said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won Gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he had disputed himself with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie, advanced in a world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, such as Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing reproaches, as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of competition in the Velodrome, it looks quite like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces by workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to assign any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A grant that has been established for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to domino effects as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry melt, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three further owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL expects that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have entered into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL believes that the contracts in financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the income on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL admitted that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its yearly closing in the amount of $187 million in" "" "anticipation of a cancellation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa insisted that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt" "" "or to ensure the supply to the melt is" "" "not impaired." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a declaration of why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Based on the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts each year and around 900 MW of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the clichéd action of almost every birthday episode of a children's program (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a transmitting site at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="8">She likes her and her husband Kanye West (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most popular edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to fashionista were from the 832 pages of the article 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin have been leaked even before the official announcement.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "break-down model" "" "of its generation - falls under the earlier category, it is in good company." ""</seg>

<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the Mistresses of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings appeared again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But going around on the Missmut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator entered the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The followers are dominating the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would range today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came into the stores exactly 20 years ago, 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months ago at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" are the same.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktoppage would change the coding for his adverts to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of which portion of the page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind Hin-and-Her battle between the inviting Open Source Community and the converters has been underway since the invention of display lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying signs of display have become for the industry.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday overcame a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" in the streets and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overpowered by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, said the police who asked them, as well as every witness of the incident, to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigative procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something that the prosecutor has to decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after passing a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street, took the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "totally unusual and unforeseen situation," the judge said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, was probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still rotated slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably indicated more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exponentially exposes its daily aspect of the sun for nearly two months," "" "said scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, some degree cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that had previously been suspected by planets.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporating and their water vapor was fired from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, the way we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods with the planet origin stand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, reach adulthood now.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now rotating the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates these mature stars repel large amounts of star winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler recognises the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massify stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">An athomed athlete could have won almost one medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle course in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and ruled out - immediately before the very beginning of the critical athletics competitions this news comes to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old won the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds they missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have been able to take part in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter very seriously and calls for full co-operation in the investigations," "" "quoted Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work with the International SportCourt CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>

<seg id="18">Danekova was preliminary suspended, according to BNT, the B-specimen was also positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's prime minister Bojko Borissov immediately announced his criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: as perfide, hackers blackmail her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware replacement.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to blackmail ransom falls significantly higher than at home users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the drawing programs were still designed to send advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past months, terrifying quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it selectively searches for unmodified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the requirements of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies affected reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there have already been several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of patient records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the perpetrators' demand in the face of standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay using Bitcoin, set free accessible support web sites or decrypt example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are private individuals redeeming after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must in part negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively low-risk profits from ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware of about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malicious software in the form of a software package to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware-Kits were developed by purchasing the malware by yourself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ a spammer with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that better ensure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to repel Ransomware by means of file backups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful performance, the perpetrators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things to the grain in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference of Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heat could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top is falling slightly.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosessel and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l-diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>

<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake assist (working until tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when maneuvering.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles if necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol gasoline from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is far from the wake ring-ringing no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inhaling and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">When sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of the German Academic Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeplessness?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially common in depression," "" "says Weak." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are subject to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who, for example, have a herniated disc, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to ponder on everyday problems and worries, gives you an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is compromised during the day, you should go to the doctor advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, tired, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any lower sleeping medicine available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, if you have problems with sleeping problems, you should contact the family doctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with breathing phrases, in case of sickness, sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler commented on the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympus via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he had brought gold for the first time at the World Cup Championships in Doha and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, the former DSV-Athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself in front of his ex-team colleagues in the critical review.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 €premium and a jungle king 150,000 €, nobody should wonder about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in swimming pool is bad, whereas doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate doping as closely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I do not say that the controls are to be set here," "" "he continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deiet would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency in Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how it should be maintained with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent inspectors of the WADA / FINA must not participate," says the election burger, who meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lines of lime, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walk along the road from east to west, passing playgrounds, a revamped kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the front of a grey house someone has "ugly"! "</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshafen, are however preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, however, on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inator handle has expressed itself several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the building workers renovated the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers stripped under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late Late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, are mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the building projects, they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted mostly police protection against the vandalient left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police between house occupants and their neighbors make up, evidently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Riga Dome.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under a large police officer in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rīga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and pollinliners from all over the world: residents of GDR times and former home owners share their Kiez with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by ripened windows or freshly painted façades that have been thrown out with bags of paint.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned so often this year along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences constitute material damage which tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rīga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved to the Riga Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of a sudden claimed the interpretation of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neugebauer the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former mosquitoes that forced the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are, in the end, condominiums that are not interesting for many - here people prefer people who are not so well searched," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never stops listening?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin has little understanding for zooms that are angry with paint bombs: the house-projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who puts into a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new commissioner for refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, working groups, refugee assistance, administration, authorities, and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the cutting-edge wool milk, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocking but rather focussing on the multitude of desirable tasks - meant that administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a cutting-edge rug of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has a 50-percent stake for three years." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honourable and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon to be found in the Wasenstrasse</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized for some time." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Federal Council to the Municipality and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it doesn't work, so be dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments need to be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "perspective is the key, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be grounded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, administration and volunteers also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can take time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach, could not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems, too, says customer truthfully, "people who don't have anything at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivating others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some people may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the killers will bring them completely into obituaries.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers will have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbach are already at full capacity to integrate the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
