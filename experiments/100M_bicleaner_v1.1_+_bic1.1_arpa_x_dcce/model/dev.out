Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing policies in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed is to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal struck by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu , at the invitation of the Republi@@ can , held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had refused it with reference to Israel &apos;s forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor tries to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ st and a hand written note , which was scri@@ b@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting in the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motiv@@ ating .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ st died , said he had no history of violence or criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses by both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed to be a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee him a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as assistant professor .
President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police subsequently found Lam@@ bs Trail when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi out of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
in the spring he completed his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ st , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ st when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arrived three years ago in a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse that worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , initiated the first semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
around 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community attended a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the University College &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associate Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb hit the emergency call after firing Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call described Pr@@ enti@@ sh as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever got married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were recru@@ ited .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is increasing from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer and companies are preparing to hire employees to sell , sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ awn and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , together with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest time travel movie ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict lasting nearly five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and to support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the Council meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ban beg@@ ged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how many Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks when poll@@ s down , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate che@@ ating .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and starting to let their dollars flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the property @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate che@@ ating positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early stages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first direct state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their bel@@ ong@@ ings , Republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week .
this is a change since the time when four from ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , it is apparent that a large number of GO@@ P voters are looking at Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp harv@@ ests the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say that they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the voters support Tru@@ mp have said that they have firmly committed their votes .
of course much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they left the door open to change candidates .
nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have made their opinions are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration and pi@@ v@@ ot point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday 6 of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration in the li@@ mel@@ ight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp apparently will do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ definitely . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ ing@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in the study - so the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really small .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price seems to be like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ ker has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residence locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros ( s ) - per square meter , mind @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here exceptionally .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
doub@@ let Tor@@ ret@@ e in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have delivered a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the witch @-@ bo@@ ilers of Pi@@ raeus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic champion in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserve with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
in his 28th consecutive win in the Champions League to the Bayern leader@@ board Müller , Müller was awarded gra@@ cious assistance from Olympic Games Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who allowed a shot of the World Champion to happen as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the King class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , here also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often launched on the left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , rarely encountered by the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k was hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by appointment , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set con@@ i@@ fers .
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er he was indul@@ ged .
so , for example , when he directed a shot of Ide@@ ye over the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had a square with David Al@@ aba in the center alongside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems in the Ka@@ der , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after gradu@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first switch , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , Müller continued to count on it by El@@ f@@ meter .
before the game it had come to the stadium in Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partially mas@@ ked Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block had apparently provoked the followers of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and introduced pun@@ ches against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , har@@ ms not only the lung , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : at ren@@ unciation the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this stems from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , increasing the 2.5 to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasizes the authors .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat falls back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , said Er@@ stau@@ bach Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained head of study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health until old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of too@@ th@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
arch@@ eological findings have been made on the right side of the Rhine in Cologne for the ump@@ teenth time .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum were excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a Department of Archae@@ ological Monum@@ ents .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with some 350 graves had been discovered that belonged to the church .
young woman from freight elevator
after a young woman is rap@@ ed at the station in the Gei@@ sel@@ stadt @-@ Lin@@ der station , the Federal Police is asking the people to help themselves .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 am the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .

European Commission proposes new courts in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to vali@@ date the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the competent EU commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de aims to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings face con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are said to have equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far the parties involved agreed among themselves to arbit@@ ers , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ State Dis@@ pute Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies can make compensation for damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or reduce consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all for not to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German State Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform that Federal Minister of Commerce Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned that limiting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy @-@ looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an with a felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of various places , which he records on the map again and again , about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderful creative irrit@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; smart composed songs sound very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ru@@ mor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states should follow in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live is enough for him with guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician who lives in New York goes back to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a popular masterpiece is celebrated in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board Charts and is no longer in the list of the influential music media .
after a very productive experim@@ entation , St@@ ev@@ ens uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) with very extensive electronic pieces .
this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the show shows here are the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in dark @-@ held Hamburg more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the clearly travelled road turns back to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to judge the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can basically disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bly thank@@ ed himself for an en@@ core , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ unde of the Prime Minister
since its election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is eag@@ erly anticipated
the new UK Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be releasing his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde and for the first time to present himself with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to take the first of his six given issues shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commemor@@ ative celebration for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; been respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC &apos;s Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of Shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are pil@@ ed up within Labour as well , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes take place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron since he is T@@ ory @-@ boss , over the last decade facing the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the freight rate of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that it will be subjected to both &quot; strike action &quot; and the strike with re@@ perc@@ ussions and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel , the Shadow Economic Minister , is represented if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the Lower House spokes@@ man to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester &apos;s theatre &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ y . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed in 1990 on television , the Fra@@ gest@@ unde was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and its leadership in the House of Commons and its position among its members of parliament , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires extensive reforms .

pounds increase through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply to data showing a rise in the income growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s goal .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and given assessments of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth once again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % after mining declared that he had spent 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labor costs at his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA Poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato screw@@ driver
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
it is both - in the potato cooler , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of d@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay m@@ ashed potatoes and meat along a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Leban@@ ese in the meantime joined the German Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility model .
therefore Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y the amount of meat and how much potatoes in the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ amor@@ tis launches stand @-@ up campaign to combat aging
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a stand @-@ up campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 outlets in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice @-@ makers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples distributed in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investment strategy ag .
there is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as a met@@ c@@ ash@@ ine I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will be able to take around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ amor@@ tization 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the amount of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s with a high fixed cost base , could cost some € 13 million in pre @-@ interest and tax profit , &quot; said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan has found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly comment on Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction combined with simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler does , however , inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight through the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison proc@@ laim@@ ing : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kr@@ amp@@ f put a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was standing ste@@ ad@@ fast .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious of is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drag@@ ged into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the dressing area , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all but he assures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm component . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around Kyr@@ gy@@ z , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick was very quick to climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all parties trying to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants joined in a man &apos;s land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations arose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were expelled from food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian fron@@ tier came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would accept more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a verbal action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency standing on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government allowed to build along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament still needs to appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , which will be expected next week , but porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Country Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ enses after the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and pressed a crowd to get there .
about 20 succeeded in coming in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head off Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates in their election .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders can only be found with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit for democratic voters under the age of 50 has been pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is elected ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ tion@@ ability are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advance ahead of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; most selective &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries stands out unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results with some important features in elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections of their party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is best cut off in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinion .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email control had no impact on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote represent Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good marks for guidance .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
the two candidates have meanwhile accounted for half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large number nationwide . support is growing at 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son took from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ze , has been defeated by Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell in deepest place , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are on third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son goes to the poll@@ s - with 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
looking at Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp@@ s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign presentation in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if top values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are not going to the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares with .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood contaminated with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a mysterious ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound kn@@ ap@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he dropped unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and allegedly warned one hour before they brought him to a hospital , such as the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and generally posed the benefit of the Brotherhood on the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with st@@ ump@@ y force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student died on the har@@ ass@@ lands every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe suggested an indictment for the third grade murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richard Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rate of interest is coming , and the hous@@ se will be sha@@ ken , yields for loans will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the initial rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have so severely stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , head econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights but still on a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a historical trend based view on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study of what happened after interest rate increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , Chief Financial Officer at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants enjoyed a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were set at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade only gives a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all excav@@ ation cycles of 1950 up to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing cur@@ v@@ ature in GDP and rec@@ essions are set in the shadows very quickly after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rate increase , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks if they change their strategic direction .
when bonds are issued , the yields seem to change direction once the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / lowering is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle the bond @-@ endi@@ ces fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer cohesi@@ on between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a defl@@ ation of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones says that the markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tigh@@ tening has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
large and large companies will benefit from the greater part of their business in the United States , benef@@ iting from interest rates when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are becoming po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar is making their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts commented in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded by 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar .
savers could see gains through higher returns , even though experts of different opinions are how quickly that is to take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked The Voice and said this wasn &apos;t very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC general director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 would be far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that hard work must be done to engage the audience when it did so in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins grab@@ bed The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for a cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
he added , he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our own barn &quot; when it launches an entertainment series for the next time .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed down expenses in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate once new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G Sales Index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales began to increase three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers ran around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the shop@@ pers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent shop@@ pers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 £ online .
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ning , largely dressed in white , the route , in order to pay their respect , when the first of the dead arrived their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed at the Holy Place where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king left a sanc@@ tion about the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
king Sal@@ man said today that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e falling into an inner courtyard of the Great Mog@@ ul , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will be held later this month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of massive building project managed by Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a retired son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
this leads to 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix outlets aimed at tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Shops will close nationwide
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home .
if you are skill@@ fully cop@@ ing with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services to grav@@ ure prices , is now out@@ dated .
thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and closing 60 selling points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this into a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed leading companies , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company that has staff@@ ed 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year gain and revenues , after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
the function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt , two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deportation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the state prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defend@@ ants had used mon@@ ies from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions , for private purposes .
it damages the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports function@@ aries are also accused of financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was retired by the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ len@@ tic@@ ist , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was formed to the association .
the sports officials had only comp@@ uted expense compensation and the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debts . in 2001 , the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in the B@@ read @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ read @-@ trades &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the financial official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there are only no debts to be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the payment of expense compensation had been decided on retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 if the financial and corresponding financial success was successful .
therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed deviations seemed to appear , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the society has not been interested in detail for financial support , but it is important that debt has been important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when investigations started against a function@@ ary investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the accused said .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim indem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore the function@@ ary said he never covered a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the accused were not able to present accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operation test in which everything was considered correct , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant was also entitled to pay the mil@@ eage .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , and from his place of residence he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his home town , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ alls more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts running for three years , the computer terri@@ ers will break down further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to cut down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this means that costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the annual reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share showed up 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the company , made up with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society this year - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a re @-@ dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to call the latest Lenovo PC .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man was re@@ acting late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more shops online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total breakdown of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rep@@ el : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed themselves in agreement .
it is 61 percent positive that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 percent , on the other hand , are in conflict with the conflict .
51 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed refused to cooperate with Syrian Mach@@ th@@ but Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 20 percent would be for it .
29 percent could not decide .

the focus of the fair will be on the 27th of September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the Frankfurt International Motor Show .
as in two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA &apos;s car association expect some 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : demoli@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police installed tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wers against several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it , a police line was formed and a water @-@ throw stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
at first the officials stopped pe@@ pper@@ ing spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees now have withdrawn a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently wounded woman was swe@@ pt away from the zone .
children who had met the tear gas shri@@ ek@@ ed .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered under breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world ob@@ serves when the US cle@@ av@@ age comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday in order to make an important decision whether interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view , that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , director of staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global conditions .
she warned the markets of sett@@ ling on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at the Delta State University left exc@@ uses writing
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - wrote Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he had shot on a man , and killed someone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ st , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb apparently believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ st was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who testified that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ st would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ st worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said I called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as police officers caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car aside , ran into the forest , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his li@@ king on the university &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the company
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros each year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of around € 500 million per year resulting from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline divided on Wednesday .
among other things , in the future Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as stand @-@ alone as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with its new position , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphasizes the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations after the strike on this Thursday should be res@@ um@@ ed in the collective conflict with the pilot association &quot; Cockpit &quot; ( VC ) .
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come to sustainable results as quickly as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving concept in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it envis@@ ages that Lufthansa is lining up routes to the Group &apos;s own low line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeated at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to cry and exclu@@ des it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and will be operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United who has a hard time and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will take and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy to escape a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , the British distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a cou@@ l@@ game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label appeared in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ prints a content of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he as@@ signs to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here an Un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the prot@@ ru@@ ding , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ ering Once @-@ ler in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a high @-@ looking , sle@@ et @-@ bear@@ ded creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax a child 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der , who has selected England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali evol@@ ves as spin @-@ bowling and adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England test cad@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been prolonged , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he kno@@ cks out further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that is not surprising me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that Britain first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I charge up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and four qui@@ cks , emerged and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ a might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred laps immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ um , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the timet@@ able .
and you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a pl@@ ums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ disp@@ utable ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with each day , even without choosing the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently viol@@ ates Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , recently said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always of its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
prime ministers and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened with the exagger@@ ated long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also an allied force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will pull out one leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press one , as it did during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his back@@ war@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , teleph@@ ones @-@ h@@ ack@@ enden ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door to him .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly tap on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just express it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ aro@@ e tendency and the wild follow@@ er of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ and@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ein Ben@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs strug@@ gled in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father worked on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C talked about his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on their convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ able bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding center of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron not a free ticket for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ites Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have also di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) were implic@@ ated in ques@@ tioning the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for choosing the board members are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include an industry financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work says that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former manager of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would be &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ober@@ haus @-@ Kommunik@@ ations @-@ Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC anyway .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambition of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his commentary on the most popular shows of the BBC shows what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart teaching in Edinburgh in 2003 suggest@@ ing that the BBC shows like East@@ enders was supposed to sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue that if they are heading to their apparent missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course , all of you think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , I wonder if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check out its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled from out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not normally react to ultrasound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves work on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report , Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ Sizegenetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ astic said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ imped@@ ed and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ epr@@ int with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I went to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken Sabbath year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; Tru@@ ly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people dress up and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I &apos;ve consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship Gibraltar by B@@ aking .
since you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk @-@ owner .
the chances are good that they say they are serving themselves , even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal as my room@@ mate adding a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which keeps people off from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it was a bit harder for them to make drum and bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut down their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be incredibly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , go to her , separate herself and see her every day and maybe see how she moves all together friends to her ?
of course , the heart walks its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not closed room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never miss someone &apos;s room with too@@ th@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room but also the mother and the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Guil@@ dner believes to know how rapidly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project row houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part of it here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need plenty of living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
bor@@ rower : a semi @-@ detached house needs least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if people are taught in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily changed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
that is appropriate .
did building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
guil@@ der : legally , I went through my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Pit@@ ch Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ der : there were those who accused me of creating lux@@ uries for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is wrong .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : it &apos;s true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the only mother or the poor @-@ ear@@ ners .
I show how to build a cheap and good building today .
that &apos;s what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made that impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off half@@ way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

you should also make sure that before you download you have seen our check@@ list of all things to prevent things going wrong and protect yourself if they do . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much more intelligent personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .
Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points dis@@ connect the vice world champion before reti@@ ring in Singapore this Sunday of defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve rounds of the season so far and will also be attacking the Grand Prix in the City State as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
for days a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighboring island Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer chess club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which pres@@ ided over Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; red @-@ white &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
lod@@ ger &apos;s office looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have put together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations one can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as health insurance or services for health and nursing homes .
for years , we have been diagnosed with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many benefits of insurance are not seldom used , because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore it is possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both executives particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also de@@ votes itself to the association at the age of age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to participate in a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar surroundings .
the Qu@@ arti@@ s office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 a.@@ m .

the city of Bremen re@@ affir@@ ms the alleg@@ ations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then I will decide whether the meadow will be displayed or not .

men test on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a sevent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters , following the police , calling them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young and hit the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ breaking and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a beat beat one checked the face and th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for the purpose of medical care .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller under@@ takes practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ breaks reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing aside for his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises on the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
Mr. Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met with sympathy at first sight , who currently met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ breaks and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of operating their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the clos@@ eness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mill@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ir@@ uss works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ ine ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the bin@@ s , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EK@@ Gs and need a speaker room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will be given to the Müll@@ ers within the scope of a funding programme of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and joyful we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , come into the practice field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
if no successor has found himself , she would have gone .
by the way , whoever visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour still looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professional employees and the cleaning power from the rock out@@ casts .
with their par@@ ting , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband compl@@ ements laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border checks are also going on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is at the forefront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people have to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refuses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue to pursue arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slov@@ ene wants to prevent his borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees in the night hours on Tuesday tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would be diver@@ ted from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously brought immigrants to the Hungarian border , con@@ forming Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to suggest people to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way all night by Serbia on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually mean that the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary had already been postpon@@ ed to a slightly further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have been witn@@ essing a good testimony to the country since then , concerning the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees will now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early on a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be at this time to deal with very high refugee figures .
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes have been marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having gained insight into yet un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ Wireless and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the information captured , in@@ sider trading was said to have been made on the financial markets .
thus , a total of more than $ 100 million has been launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the SE@@ C statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are to have acted both in the United States and Eastern Europe .

therefore this public@@ ity action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to publicly disclose themselves on the tablets is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and dying still remains with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ and@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning assistant is one of the volunteer workers of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe pain@@ stak@@ ingly sought an official call , she immediately reported herself and was involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ and@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives are accompanied by private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ and@@ roid can cope well with her task and the experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ p , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further education and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the tables on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there other personal wishes can be written on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects decreased for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant s@@ unk his outlook over a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. agreed to earn a profit of between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than the earlier forecast .
analysts were expecting a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect is despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ ship transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions , higher revenues and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yiel@@ ding solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday jobs were announced one day later than those of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted 12 analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts predicted revenues of € 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales of the body transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings because of higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher labor cost in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies are spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
the wall picture of the United States is im@@ pending over them at the end of the decorated two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here to hold steady .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive through the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it is experiencing solid growth , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal loans - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage wheel jump@@ ed 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , head econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far in order to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate of interest would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen agreed that this year , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was anticipated .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed views as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered a bit this month , while the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when it is to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events hadn &apos;t occurred in the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would have put the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; their monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to supervis@@ e not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management at En@@ vel@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which seems to be not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rate increase , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited percep@@ tible impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives undo these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market shake @-@ out , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Inter@@ est Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest rate because the markets upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often called Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the public .
yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .
the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations .
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
the shop is huge and it takes over an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
if the whole grocery you make hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the coff@@ ers and has various take @-@ over options .
what is there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more .
the meat @-@ counter is extensive , as is the fish counter - the staff behind the bar will clean and fil@@ et the fish and even fry on request for you .
a good part of the cargo belongs to the massive freeze department . here you will find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ ing , whole du@@ cks , fish , cattle blood and g@@ all , pigs , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more .
who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals .
the wide courses are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you can find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany for these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still very happy with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande to promote healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition is during breast feeding . it does this with the presentation of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy nutrition of the child can have a negative impact on the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building on the Bern@@ ese Sport@@ complex is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community meeting , the construction application has been unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
among other things , the committee had decided , among other things , to apply for a legislative &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a permit for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , a saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ter first and roof over@@ hang is to be erected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof area for solar plants is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderful South @-@ roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is supposed to lie under ten degrees for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the a@@ version does not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese municipal council is usually rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating agreements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not a recurring project . &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense of costs .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude racing .
in the next step the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Federal Council for Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH des Land@@ kreis , the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were to be implemented , all the nearly 50 staff at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would be busy .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au by Fischer and the existing In@@ ner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff will be informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year , has now switched to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who is to follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1st and change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases on the inside .
for the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses , will finally be closed to the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ end@@ om , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the ongoing rehabilitation at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Land@@ lord J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , contra@@ ven@@ ed ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will hen@@ ce@@ forth be used as shelter for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m closing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions today is called for at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) .
the Table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but none exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bad@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; got a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something good there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ fall with two injured near Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police shared .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was initially unclear .
the crime police as@@ cer@@ tained .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young@@ sters were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor and the police shared this Wednesday .
in fact , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old captured on Tuesday evening , who did indeed state the statement , led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the evening after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons , a suspici@@ on was finally revealed against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ rac@@ tor was in police rog@@ ation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put him in charge .
information on the near@@ er circumstances of the deed should lead to further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing shortage
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable stays .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is faced with a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution disputes in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing units , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction industry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers after the first three months of their stay .
many then drive onto the housing market and row into the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit which is growing from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 housing units already lack@@ ed in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in large cities in need of accommodation in EEC rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were un@@ willing to stay longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vac@@ ancy in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has been declining for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should again boost social housing construction .
thus , the value added tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is subject to a limited period of time .
furthermore , according to the alliance , attractive tax de@@ position possibilities are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters at the German State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have already been retri@@ eved on Monday night with 184 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia address Cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no passage anymore , as more and more refugees are choosing their way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing its transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ or for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the sab@@ ot@@ age of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , practically obvi@@ ate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through and we are preparing for this eventu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country in Croatia on the morning .
most of the media reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are supposed to quickly establish a safe passage .
after the closure of the border no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 attacked people .
just before the deadline on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws sets the overcoming and damage of the border between us as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed there were therefore 35 criminal proceedings .
the condemned prison sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the newly established transit zones on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning more than 40 refugees would have stayed there .
but practically no one has a chance to be granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian agenda , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the transit zone in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers begin to clean up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the bar@@ racks in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself at the end of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees reach Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stra@@ dd@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly there were ten people with travel sponsors at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein final , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before that , we first cho@@ king the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers climbed from an ICE to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to make it possible after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still across the border .
the regional train , however , was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the river Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a brid@@ ge@@ head sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further thousands to us , is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly tra@@ cked the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees also will have to note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to make decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ proof quar@@ ts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has to do all his hands fully with refugee accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the first Tak@@ eover Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday is without major f@@ uss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ ri@@ dden situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings need to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these would have assured him , even for the coming refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Qu@@ arti@@ ere &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels which stand empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing them as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that neighbour@@ hoods have to maintain a certain amount of towel holders or size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a period of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the Ministry of Interior , he is more successful in placing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad says with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , who is not to say to the face the un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
the Republic does not inc@@ ur any costs of Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
our own qu@@ arti@@ s search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centre for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since it is possible to accommodate those concerned without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be tested for their suitability .
the City Council critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
also other districts have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a lengthy phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has drawn up further action on Monday in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available .
however , the seek@@ ers were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is again introducing controls at its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved into , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact Jutta Bri@@ eit wanted to acquire a dog .
this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has gotten from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are caught in the sight of a hand@@ bag , the lady &apos;s wife cannot answer with last security .
perhaps it &apos;s up to you that a nice bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for excit@@ ers .
whether it is hostile to foreign journalists , to journalists or to reveal gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair @-@ hair@@ style is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some people in the 1200 inhabitants place are related to it over -@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , to which besides Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is &quot; a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in Hoch@@ german : the investors , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate group was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute of Ar@@ med History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he is pol@@ ed , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grandfather was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the veter@@ an in retirement sees the American more dist@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ists Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz came to a visit something for the church organ , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had been in the USA at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 movi@@ ego@@ ers , also in the USA are awake the interest .
the Upper Bavarian Municip@@ ality of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
from the hands of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig us@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise is domin@@ ating the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rus@@ hed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise posted an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , in comparison to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September , sunrise will have an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , revealed an average of 44@@ 6.000 visitors .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute which didn &apos;t manage to over@@ look the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret unveiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood , finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day , before coming from three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods received last Rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both knew quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
on the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam &apos;s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were pretty compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; says Je@@ wel@@ s Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserved for him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula tru@@ sts his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt Return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter , Cam In@@ man , reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his sc@@ rap@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .

it certainly wasn &apos;t the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL &apos;s debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .

free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ van@@ ger was warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn convention in big wall@@ stadt for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get wor@@ sen@@ ing in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free State Parliament &apos;s parliament conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did during the Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Independent voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Ai@@ van@@ ger also called for more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for compl@@ ying with asylum : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more responsive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s politics in large wall@@ ets should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing long @-@ standing burner remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , started the pilot project &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the secondary school from three to four years is tested .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
stronger Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on le@@ aps
the German stock market has closed with profits over long stretches of direction @-@ driven and nervous trading history .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber shells on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber shells into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday said .
the violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , chief district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before re@@ treating to rubber shells .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber shells used , known from which they can kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last of weeks of violent protests in Nepal on southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ r@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces which are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the T@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
killed August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ator voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
it is waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
the investor in question is not yet clear .
no contracts had yet been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner Große Straße , already purchased a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ gli@@ ders are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure center
months had been negotiated , gri@@ eved , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now there are plans for a new holiday cottage near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on the offensive from the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
the images and new details of the desired hotel structure called forth heavy responses under sea bu@@ d owners who had come to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the land@@ owner and board member of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch to@@ wered above all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus inv@@ itations must come so that this can be calculated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hectare large area of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / , low to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mort@@ ality data requires a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to consume food .
over the years , obes@@ e operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the new study included researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I of those who underwent this surgery sank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes disease fell completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was resolved completely only at one percent and in some cases with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BM@@ I lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama tou@@ red Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
toxic control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ cide in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children can visi@@ bly drink dis@@ infection while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ infection just because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , only a few sp@@ lashes can cause alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky lying around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah R@@ Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry du@@ ck disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered to be drunk in an adult , &quot; said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah close her words and was unable to walk as she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection clo@@ ths and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York were planning to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ishes her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the sworn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland there are no highlights of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ ger is not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
you are talking about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic battles have to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the following expul@@ sion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of guys are very , very angry or sad about what &apos;s happening .
we are feeling this - but we have to go on .
we really need Celtic support because it makes players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he hur@@ ried a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious in signing new entran@@ ces and insist@@ ing that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with return reference
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and did not finish the finish of Wales this summer .
heard Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts had 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent off the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was cancelled later - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on any achievement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ ran@@ ny
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked , after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident happened in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ ha@@ ce Supervisory Board has trust in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is said that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in desper@@ ately to see a seventh consecutive league win , which brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases overall in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of Ukrain of 5.5 percent , as showed the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( O@@ NS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the average annual average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken troubles@@ ome the drain
since security personnel were unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geons into custody .
a breathing @-@ alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and initially remained in custody .
why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than seats , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ commodity , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked about the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to &quot; return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a house peace incident in Pel@@ vic ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ er rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ drew for 18 months for the no@@ stal@@ gic charges and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about raised head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had allowed the bomb to go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I would name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it will be personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it right now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fru@@ strations @-@ levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching introduced that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ folded Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse deb@@ its , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day , which was so .
but it also had so on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy might be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats rival to fight against ri@@ vals
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has den@@ ounced the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark about the Storm Team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the tac@@ king of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him confidence because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten up by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s up and down again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring@@ ing when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing in our defensive system or the techniques . but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this always occurs at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters played a higher result than the match Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks make and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team has released this weekend because they won the right to either win North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on the next Tuesday morning .
ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug traffi@@ cking
a man who might face a life @-@ long punishment for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 b@@ ail .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long penalty for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of flight with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of penalty , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous statements of the two individuals , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damage deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ rog@@ ated his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stays at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab Tou@@ ches apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to ev@@ ade the last moment to the left , as the police shared .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ crash culp@@ ture completely demoli@@ shed .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed after six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girl to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of continuous pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and instantly al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police looked at it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computer that was found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for im@@ pending images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and weeping .
she then also saw the im@@ pending images on the phone and thus confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of having taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of this year to have viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the sexual offen@@ ders &apos; Register , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael wa@@ its the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
it was recorded before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ dge transfers to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up at the German @-@ Austrian border outside of the main control points .
many bad users led people to smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the coun@@ ties of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ubs to the German side .
there they are received by the Bundes@@ polic@@ emen and forwarded to the registration .
according to the Federal Police Head@@ quarters , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison to the beginning of the week .
by 8 : 00 AM alone , some 700 people had arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : off@@ shoots of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southwest expected &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against stor@@ ks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart distributed .
the powerful depression was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands .
storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea rice with arches of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd is doing it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , it is above all the movement in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17th to 27th September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the major premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the show .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view , starting at 17@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ essi@@ ans provide further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors in the VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which will also be seen at the IAA .
and what will be driving on new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an ultra @-@ sporty GT @-@ version .
he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , and then as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan spac@@ er wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts perfectly to the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel of 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger delivered a hand at the front end . here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple Car@@ Play .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI have been added at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ am Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ prisoner of the At@@ tor@@ ney General Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary facility between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to information of his lawyer , was now again on the free foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
but the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Chamber of Appe@@ al in Berlin and rejected the case for re @-@ examination there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity broken .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , an equ@@ ation was given , it was called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money indem@@ ni@@ fication .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they spoke only in April to a det@@ ain@@ ee , because he was det@@ ained naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff had lived for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons had been hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to m@@ all@@ ying it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not busy due to the lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do in Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the unusual challenge , German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we manage it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
however , the lack of living space is dramatic , above all with affordable rental objects : between 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing units from the rental price are dropped every year , and these particularly favorable flats will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
far too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments must be built every year and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that long @-@ term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education , critic@@ ises the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich heir hardt .
in Germany , according to the throne of Germany , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence obligation , which restric@@ ts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , due to the shortage of skilled labour , the view is mostly enforced that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the view of Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the king &apos;s way to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration found that only a few refugees give their children into the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ hab@@ bel , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Be@@ ate St@@ ack@@ ers of Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion or des@@ ul@@ sion do not get any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; law if they start their studies .
the latter generally do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the eligible individuals .
patient @-@ patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months .
this financing gap , however , must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively enter into Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the founding of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , would also be important .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic for the whole company in the future .
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slowly learning how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders are demanding for a long time and which international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism conflict are committed to Germany must become a reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far , says Doctor Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we are creating this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be invested in the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to buy health cards immediately .
achievements could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to collect as many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers possible .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that immigrants are less educated about their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees , however , have already been helped with more general medical centres in emergency out@@ patients .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities in refugee camps , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ enlightenment .
with the partly other diseases German doctors are coming from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so hard to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , even allevi@@ ation may be seen by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some of them are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass tests further .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill based on estimates by the Bundes@@ Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , are particularly vulnerable .
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who suffers from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration difficulties , severe de@@ form@@ ability and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit a request for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , function@@ aries or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to the man@@ ege on the tile - v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and junior chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the family , therefore , is in the blood the gift for travellers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take people away from their daily mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosmop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
winning at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family cat@@ ches the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their handic@@ raft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cub@@ an duo wants to take up easily .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon fill@@ ers , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility .
balance the Whe@@ el on a Sphere ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
ser@@ pent people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with her flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does it not work well for our animals , it is not good for us too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; artists , as they are lovingly called , are read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the upper@@ most commandment is good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on its zeb@@ roid @-@ jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if 5 or 1 200 people , we always do our best and we are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst starts every day from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 p.m. and 5 p.m .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the show at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , daily the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video footage spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ops .
in the last month they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of Parliament that immunity will end in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard will probably disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today is , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ met , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it spl@@ its a company established in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University of Bill and Dave Packard in order to establish electro @-@ installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely @-@ focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and insofar as his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in the light of his story , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended up the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone not healed well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 League games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it , a small bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to spread through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ i@@ ority in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 matches after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League Cap@@ it@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the association with his management to his first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as evi@@ den@@ ced by young men among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication with social media , with their emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments on football coaching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely get involved , even if they often stop to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of teleph@@ ony care , it told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ ordained has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League , Maria meets on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ parking stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met for less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on his way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before finally reaching their advantage when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they are not only striving for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ sy of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw at his own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was designated as the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tis Pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he finished off to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who struck the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some failures and bad degrees , last but not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five attempts was scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth place of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be kept low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game from them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from changing to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the engagement of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times championship winner , four times champion league winner , twice world champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi is now showing that he had already stood before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann assumed the role of FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man is working for the German record champion today : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the grass , the reds broke out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on to play diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian restra@@ ined themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ l brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direction rights of the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni put his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS you &apos;re hur@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a national effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the living .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished off her 7th season , never experienced a competition participant that could complete all the stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to reach the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course at all , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great gratu@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit tiger sli@@ me past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ -- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild card place .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad A@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit was three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ ring any game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has washed the drums , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ room , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ end at the end of the seventh inner , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escap@@ es a Two @-@ Run to the right @-@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen directly brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time the major league leader in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
when Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth session , Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and reached the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ acks S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for its fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of an even non @-@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been eliminated from the game of injuries after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third b@@ aker Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers came in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit especially well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the wor@@ shi@@ pers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder strain , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP announced Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August because of a tick in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden d@@ anced on Tuesday evening .
it was reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommodated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the government pres@@ idency , responsible for the first recording , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse .
thanks to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective pav@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was said that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls at the southern and eastern border
after Germany , Austria also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , said Mr Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new approach to the binding allocation of further 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee deaths in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the Länder , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection also complain .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you won &apos;t be able to stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from passing through Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the proposed new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , as a result of e@@ ye@@ witness testim@@ onies , thousands of other migrants are on their way to the Greek border .

while this motion is only small , but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is written in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon in 2006 , sp@@ ying the water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not cleared .
R@@ ama is missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München needs to for@@ ego Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation carried out an ad@@ duction injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association distributed .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to break four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible obligation of a law@@ less pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
for man@@ gan@@ ese contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gan@@ ese contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits consequently support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gan@@ ese should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel @-@ color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it moder@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

first blow @-@ out tower , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , the valley of the Alps of the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland divided on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for th@@ urs@@ day , the hair @-@ horn partially blows through the barrel @-@ valleys with storm @-@ strength .
following F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the side of the Alps , on the night , on Wednesday of the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows up to Thursday morning in the valleys with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can advance in places to the neighboring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ bu@@ ds of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my gro@@ aning cares for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ow at the alpine clo@@ ak .
here rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
a total of over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , this after large rainf@@ all has already fallen in recent days .
on Thursday morning the blow starts out , as a result , a cold front swe@@ eps with strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east across Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind strongly refres@@ hes up to stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it becomes sunny on the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther Place in Rome .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for the fellowship of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the secret of centuries as a minority .
with the square , in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a welcome sin @-@ b@@ abel .
according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther , with his theses against the decline of aband@@ on@@ ment , introduced the spl@@ itting of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes gave the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite intim@@ i@@ dating .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subjects of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
with this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry clasp has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to give twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
in the end , emotions were at all trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Mor@@ avian Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education took place already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to get this up , and perhaps to bring myself back to the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to make art more important in the quick@@ est possible time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt also wants the viewers to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he lear@@ ns life with his paintings . &quot;
I didn &apos;t take care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious topics for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X trains close
plans , place found , companies commissioned to model Earth guar@@ dian for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured a dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hills deposited , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval was given in October , the first joint saw Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Child and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga holds a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics to help tackle the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the law office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the crucial turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals put a clear sign if they will carry the print &quot; Wir helfen - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot , rather than the usual sponsor @-@ logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports chief Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees is going on for everyone , nobody can look away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football feder@@ ates , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig compl@@ ained of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will be providing 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up all the money for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses sight of an accident
according to several reports , the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , impot@@ ent , has then thrown out onto the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally failed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high intensity of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ck@@ le will not only change his stem size at the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change in the position of the door .
that is why novel Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of master keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , however , she left the door open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the research of fellow real@@ tor Re@@ us that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the European League needs to be the goal , says middle field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot &apos;s cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is expected to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday to adopt a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the IAA in Frankfurt on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio .
to test new technology , a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ approximately internationally that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government is also keen to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
when automated driving , the car takes the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads should be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic @-@ politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly explained .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the audit organization Dek@@ ra , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent will only count in 20 years with it , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the USA .
the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to abandon the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic could still be 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in the traffic jam .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis Euro
according to current status , the Düsseldorf will only be able to beat the title fight from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf over the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship service in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the sett@@ lers @-@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also missed , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejected attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you enter the museum .
the impressive collection had already been done in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was done : to fr@@ o the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to the cur@@ ator , 14 tons of material have gone to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they did not get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
it used to be about the long stit@@ ching machine in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been canc@@ eled .
private business and wholesale distribution is almost no longer available .
our products do not yet reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk commodity is manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been producing a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the University of Applied Sciences at the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies , who have to think economically above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
the machine is sti@@ cking small chi@@ cks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ mat@@ ek Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not a re @-@ movie but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already stands firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy has to open wide to the outside to promote growth , &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was charged with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population register system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of great importance as it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the lawyers &apos; right to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury border value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , thereby increasing consumers a much higher dose of the toxins .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf &apos;s midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram in exchange for this e@@ asing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch called this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low loaded , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of cl@@ ots is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal , highly toxic to humans , which is highly enriched by the food chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government is therefore warning that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities can cause very little damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the maximum allow@@ ances , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tonnes of mercury each year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and surface @-@ covering &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warnings in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
