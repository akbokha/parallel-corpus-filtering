Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement @-@ building and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal raised by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had refused this with reference to Israel &apos;s forthcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was rooted in a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police officer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fat@@ eful emergency at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal background .
he himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a complaint for health reasons and said he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police subsequently found Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long@@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met with common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time , he was the Woman &apos;s Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a couple of time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arrived in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ce Night on 5 September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica player before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ est .
Schmidt , the dead professor , initiated the first semester seminar programme and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people participated in the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and attended a commemor@@ ative ceremony , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community .
Sch@@ mid@@ t &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the University &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be picked up on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associate Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ce described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give a chance to work with his employees and seasonal workers for more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were employed .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shop@@ pers who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated g@@ out and a length of arms away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel movie ever turned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s strengthened military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in poll@@ s down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating real estate che@@ ating .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them had only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s stamina and start to let their dollars flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that property @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw real estate che@@ at positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; happy , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anger@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anger@@ ed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters in the Republi@@ can voters believe that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they expose their schol@@ ar hats , republi@@ can voters stop Tru@@ mp for real .
when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s leadership while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp Fans says that they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say that they have fixed their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Republi@@ can say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign against two months ago , was the immigration turning and fishing point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp is crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday 6 of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son are now accounted for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ can say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent are &quot; mis@@ erable . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several ten@@ ths of a thousand Euros - per square meter , well @-@ realised .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here exceptionally .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
question : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ah@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ urn of Pi@@ raeus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic champion in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) worthy of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
in his 28th consecutive hit in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership , Müller received a good help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had passed a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the King class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was proud here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often launched on the left side Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed by the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storm , Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct take @-@ off , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er he was forgiven .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New he left Guardi@@ ola to defend a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , sat outside .
the World Cup hero had given green light only after the final training , &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ ak Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s already vi@@ cious . &quot;
even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Götz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , Müller added to it by El@@ f@@ meter .
in front of the game it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience block obviously provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Potsdam long @-@ term study near .
good news : at ren@@ unciation the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this stems from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ing falls back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , said Er@@ du@@ ke Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people of being non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Head of Study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health until high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of too@@ th@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
arch@@ eological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department for archaeological soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church .

European Commission proposes new courts in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to vali@@ date the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is said to result in the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings clearly show that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far the involved parties agreed among themselves to arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , comm@@ ited Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work towards an international investment court according to their own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings required mainly by large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , by which companies can make damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , remove national laws , or reduce consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was especially critici@@ zed that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Economic Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considers the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with a felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he records on the map again and again , about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative artist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; smart composed songs seem to be very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ru@@ mor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would be the first part of a ser@@ ene series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician who lives in New York goes back to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ flowing with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens can then be used extensively on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with any effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here are the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ kept Hamburger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests now sit in their chairs , the clearly arranged St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and you can thus throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens would only be thank@@ ful for an en@@ core , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ unde of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be releasing his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ acy and will make his debut with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions briefly , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to har@@ den the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several titles of titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were called to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changed to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory chief , across the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s inquiry is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; strike action &quot; and the stri@@ kers with clas@@ hes , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minist@@ erial ministers , is represented if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch of Jud@@ y , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ y . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed in 1990 on television , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have ar@@ gues that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pounds increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply according to data , indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and generated estimates of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company had reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labor costs for his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

more or more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Rud@@ zin@@ ski .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
but since 7 am the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ damer Platz .

compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also bending itself does not .
he has taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super @-@ cash he scored three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ anz@@ ee company pur@@ ged many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and over the counter , bending is also cas@@ hier .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window window .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber was finally in place in the United States and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA Poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or d@@ öner ?
it is both - and in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ter instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay Pot@@ ato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer is spinning in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea came to the Leban@@ ese in the meantime to enter the patent office in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there she has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay is therefore not willing to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes along well with its customers .
met@@ cash starts ground resistance campaign to combat aging
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a fertility campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , brands such as ice @-@ makers S@@ immo made from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investment strategy ag .
there is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share compared to New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predic@@ tion is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amount of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of high fixed cost base could cost met@@ cash around € 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , will fall 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in terms of equal pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs to El@@ an will be set up and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis ban Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious argument of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison crying out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he broke a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was defended ste@@ ad@@ fast .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty sc@@ ary about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drag@@ ged into the stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gios on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm part . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not all around the controversy surrounding &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has quickly made the climb on what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the cri@@ tiques he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency state , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants joined a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a land @-@ strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were expelled from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency standing on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insist@@ ed that most upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament still needs to appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , which will be expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of the off@@ ence of crimes against the new laws .
authorities are thereby quick to repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to go there .
about 20 succeeded in coming into it , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he has can@@ ted for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the beginning of the pre @-@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in men has decreased mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s benefit for democratic voters less than 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when it was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ tion@@ ability are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice @-@ President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to race for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advance ahead of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has decreased by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most selective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate stands out as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in elec@@ ting their party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best deals with the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
in general , the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the previous elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had wor@@ sen@@ ed .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good marks on leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp at nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large number . support is growing up 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son took from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also yiel@@ ded that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest , and from 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent ABC News / Washington Post survey showed also Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if top values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer going to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea is divided into this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares with .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic they are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and allegedly waited one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the Brotherhood &apos;s well @-@ being basically about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeatedly added injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died on the har@@ ass@@ lands since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for Mor@@ ning &apos;s third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also account for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rate of interest comes , and the land@@ se will get lost , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a view on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rate , rather flat in the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed specification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants made a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all excav@@ ation cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on rec@@ essions received very fast after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months .
the firm income was volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks if they change their strategic course .
with bonds , the yields seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond @-@ endi@@ ces fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates tends to draw closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a defl@@ ection of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , loan tension has expanded and the volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in large and large companies , companies that engage in the greater part of their business operations in the United States profit from this , when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with weak balance after each of the interest rate increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also referring to the BBC Music Awards and said that they did not im@@ itate The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differenti@@ ate from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he was also referring to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I really consider important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work is needed to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports for it under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time there was an entertainment serie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased 3 years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that &apos;s one , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday Phen@@ om@@ enon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times saw the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the shop@@ pers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent shop@@ pers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spend a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia removes the collapse of some of the huge Sau@@ dis bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route , in order to pay their respect , when the first of the dead comp@@ eted their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went over to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden , due to the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 wounded , imposed a sanc@@ tion .
the bodies of 29 star@@ ters who were killed as a crane over@@ threw the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch at the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into an inner courtyard of the grand@@ mo@@ ury , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch who later took place this month were gathered together .
the bin Laden Group has not issued statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ ury as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government representatives ordered 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has lag@@ ged behind
this leads to 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales offices throughout the country
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home .
if you are skill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their houses , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe to offer services to grav@@ y prices has now been over@@ hau@@ led .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and 60 selling points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed leading companies , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and revenues , after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deportation on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the state prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the years 2006 to 2011 mon@@ ies from club accounts , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions , used for private purposes .
he har@@ med the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was divided by the president of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted that at no time an asset was created .
the sports officials had only comp@@ uted expense compensation and the sports club , for whom it had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ read@@ mill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the financial team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts to be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the payout of allowance compensation had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 with corresponding financial success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely since 2003 , when a plus on the account has been paid out .
therefore l@@ ump and not detailed deviations appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the events .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for financial backing - important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account in the case of a function@@ ary investigation .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why indem@@ ni@@ fication ? , wanted judge and prosec@@ utor to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never got a cent salary , he only calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged the association 1,000 euros a month , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added .
the accused were not able to present accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operating test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ ly money was also the second defend@@ ant .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , with that he had to travel to the bank from his home town to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ alls more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the recruitment of personnel for three years , the computer terri@@ ers will be able to reduce further jobs during the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions in the US computer terri@@ fic Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this means that costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company shared on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP has had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share subscri@@ bed to 2.3 percent .
the company from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently .
sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans will see the disman@@ tling of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , was largely rejected by ref@@ using : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , denied 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for it .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show
at the centre of the fair stand for connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility until September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organizers of the V@@ DA automobile association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : demoli@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police put on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ laun@@ chers against several hundreds of displaced refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it , a police line was formed and a water @-@ lamp stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set off pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees now have withdrawn a bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered under breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Ser@@ b police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to rise to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at the Delta State University left for ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb told the staff of the emergency call that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ st worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that I called for relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University as his li@@ king on the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their luck charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor allegedly tried to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group remo@@ del@@ ing .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of around € 500 million per year resulting from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new creation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines tra@@ cked under the umbrella of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the Cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed after the court stopped on this Thursday .
this shared the union with .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to come to sustainable results &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving concept in addition to the pilot &apos;s transitional provision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is envis@@ aged that Lufthansa Cargo is lining up the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own low cost line in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external defender to tears and exclu@@ des him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then take the six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red himself .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of the PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost mem@@ ori@@ ally .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camping , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams , fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; she reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agrees to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here an Un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , Th@@ need kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler despite the protests of the name @-@ giving bay , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax a child 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
to come across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have selected the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
message : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this - players are their own best choice .
a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that Britain initially set out Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist , whom I charge high .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team@@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he made three hundred laps immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master @-@ coup .
it is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing room even if the messages are in line with the previously predicted .
Coll@@ i &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I did not have a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team manufacturers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy gets into a pl@@ um until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fulfilled ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently crum@@ bled across Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at and recently said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises such as the EU is now and not always full of own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it happened in the exc@@ essively long exp@@ atri@@ ates such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a powerful force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers possibly intentionally not plan useful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t anything from ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his restra@@ int , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers foreigners and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly tap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s years to repeat , a mistake then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I just pressure it out - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ one tendency and the wild follow@@ er of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , when the boy sc@@ outs strug@@ gled in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be agile and loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on their convention on Monday night .
whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding facility of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron not a free card for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities on Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when it can all be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the general public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International according to reports .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco @-@ management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ isc@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear demonstration of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication @-@ Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put its production on programs that others don &apos;t make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er- is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this public television should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they are going to pay for their hypo@@ the@@ tical missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , think of all , we all think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , I wonder if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should check out its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of &quot; inform@@ ing , clearing up and talking about publicly @-@ legal broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter Alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ grams &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound particles .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled from qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that worms revealed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ grams , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not normally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did so when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves function on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the wort cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ Sizegenetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ grams could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ imped@@ ed and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and subway trains and that require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : go from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the fonts of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ marks of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank .

the 300 posters are of artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group contributed to the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ Pack of Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet are gaining . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists come to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade plac@@ ards gre@@ ets the commu@@ ter in the subway .
the am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP who works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising campaign for the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire - through a Le@@ erst@@ elle des Ex@@ ce@@ L Calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ epr@@ int with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture appliances at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture appliances are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapon fair comes from the area within Ex@@ ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantas@@ tically im@@ pover@@ ished eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order from the US Army on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS shot off the shoulder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uniquely shaped bra@@ cing head that delivers outstanding reproduction effects inside the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever that causes , it will not be pleasant .
eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I went to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long@@ standing complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ to @-@ write to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , where and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love neither love nor hate Mar@@ m@@ ite because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not talk even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I &apos;ve consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal as my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people off from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb that are sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if it was a matter of making drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut down their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly enter the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be too deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , go back to her , to separate herself and see her every day and maybe see how she over@@ comes all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .

terra@@ ced houses for refugees , singles , Ger@@ ing@@ Ver@@ dien@@ er
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the mid @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian corner @-@ valley row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the poor servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how rapidly affordable housing can be created : it builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space for the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : legally , I passed my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the threatening D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Sonder@@ bau und die Stell@@ platz Ord@@ in@@ ance .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is wrong .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the poor .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build even today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps in order to create space - but Apple has made this more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool , delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone may turn off at half way and this could lead to break@@ out of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded three months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , who accepted Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be advanced .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ s@@ büro looks for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations you can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office was opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as care insurance or services for health and nursing homes .
for years , we have been committed to our out@@ patient care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely do many services of the insurance companies are not used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore it is possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center will see both business executives particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the various districts of Bamberg in the future .
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the equ@@ alisation at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able participation . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 am .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus informed on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus receives an honorary member and at the same time one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was mentioned in the programme .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology in Vienna during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was charged with the establishment of the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz into the Austrian Theatre Museum .

men pro@@ verb@@ s on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the road from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters , calling them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck this man with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their apartment and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the wounded went to the building in order to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under the help of a stroke , we checked the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the wounded had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 m tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police are asking witnesses and indications to report on the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller real@@ ises field breaks and investments 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
in addition , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on the 1st of October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ breaks reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus years ago came to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their professional training in the Ver@@ den hospital and wants to get into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ er would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ breaks and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea , in future , liked the couple Müller to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ er bought the house with practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ times family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is actively involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ver@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the bin@@ s , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EK@@ Gs and need a subscri@@ ber room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro will be given by the waste land@@ fill programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and joyful we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ chap@@ lain Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l come into practice in the practice of rock breaks , in the North German A@@ verage Practice , there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another home doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
if no successor has found himself , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , inci@@ dentally also looks forward to familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rock @-@ stand .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little melanch@@ oly after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still seeing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements laugh@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border checks are also on our southern border &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to place a asylum request can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refused . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not want to seal his borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government communicated , the first refugees had already tried to leave T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in the night hours on Tuesday to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought immigrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , con@@ forming Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to suggest the people to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard Hungary admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a slightly further west@@ ward route to the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary which has already been predicted by ob@@ servers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee figures at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes have been marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

while some pass@@ ers spontaneously interven@@ es to the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; go with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , small discussions about the action are developing , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone is interested in the tables publicly , however , is understandable , finally , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death still remains with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open themselves .
an app@@ rais@@ al that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and funeral accompan@@ ist belongs to the volunteer workers of the first hour .
through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking an honorary official , she immediately announced herself and had been part of the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can cope well with their task and the experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ p , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of mort@@ al and funeral directors .
every two years training is offered for new employees .
the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes for post@@ cards can also be recorded there .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 decreased
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than with earlier predic@@ tion .
analysts predicted in a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
in spite of the price increases , the less prospect will be 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher charges for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nevertheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid income , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation jobs were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts predicted revenues of $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most awa@@ ited convention in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
im@@ min@@ ent over them at an end of the decorated two @-@ storey se@@ eding hall is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the card is a reminder that F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive through the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious representatives afraid to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently were inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far too far in explaining the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress to increase the sentence .
although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered a bit this month , whereas the Dow is now around 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events hadn &apos;t occurred in the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would have put on the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the effects on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere mention of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to supervis@@ e not only the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which seems to be not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rate , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower their interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited percep@@ tible impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the 2008 Mark@@ tz@@ ite quar@@ ry , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Inter@@ est Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest rate because the markets upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yeah , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the public .
yes , he is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .
the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewellery and Christmas decorations .
there is even a car section when you need engine oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
if the whole shopping cart makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the coff@@ ers and has various tak@@ eover options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish counter - the staff behind the bar will clean and filter the fish and even fry on request for you .

the wide gears are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you can find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles at the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still teaching with her 74 sequences .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
among other things , the committee had decided , among other things , an application for a legislative &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the applicable plan of development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ek first and roof over@@ lay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof area for solar systems is : &quot; through this we get a wonderful large south @-@ roof together , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energetic reasons - differently than stipulated in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of building permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the roof inclin@@ ation - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at is usually rather restric@@ tive in terms of deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense of costs .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision is made to the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were to be implemented then all the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff will be informed of the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer will work with his team , if the supervisory board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses until then next year , the former hospital of the tu@@ g , which has more than 35 beds , will be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the currently ongoing rehabilitation of the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , contra@@ ven@@ ed rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , should be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m closing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the quasi move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .

Jag@@ dun@@ fall with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police shared .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was initially unclear .
the crime police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was admitted to kill the young people and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police arrived on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , taken on Tuesday evening , also counts as suspect and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the evening after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquaintances he finally found a suspici@@ on against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities said that the police inter@@ rog@@ ated the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead bodies in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put his death toll on him .
information on the immediate circumstances of action should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing shortage
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year .
in this way 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ time accommodation .
many come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a deficit in Germany that grows bigger from year to year .
currently there are already approximately 77@@ 0,000 residential units in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study compl@@ ains .
many working people therefore lived in large cities into EEC rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults were un@@ willing to stay in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vac@@ ancy in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives are to boost the social housing construction again .
thus , the tax on the under@@ tak@@ ings could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments is subject to a limited period of time .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia establish cor@@ rid@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , since more and more refugees are choosing the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which entered into force on the same day make allow@@ ances practically unnecessary in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach a border fence .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before the deadline on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws prec@@ lu@@ de the overcoming and damage of the border between us as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed there were therefore 35 criminal proceedings .
convic@@ ted sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; were met on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees staying there .
practically no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier gri@@ ds have been disman@@ tled and one of the record stores in the border area has been reconstructed .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees reach Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the order of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday , when ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; as Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red over the border to Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we had the un@@ expect@@ edly invited guests once more , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had climbed from a train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to make it possible after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still over the border .
the regional train , however , was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ piece run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending another Z@@ ig@@ ail to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ the@@ tical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the camp immediately at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly tra@@ cked the position of the Hungarian government into the administrative district of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees must also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the nearby winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the look@@ out for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quar@@ ts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has to do all his hands fully with refugee support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Con@@ rad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the first Tak@@ eover Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday should be without a great vor@@ tex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master@@ power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , there are still 35@@ ,000 accommodations found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create quot@@ a for the next refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; big expectations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also come into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels which are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that neighbour@@ hoods need to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the over@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a period of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in placing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom you don &apos;t say in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t cause the republic as they explained themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
the own qu@@ ack search has not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the person concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be checked for their suitability .
criticism of the city &apos;s head of the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) accepted further action in the refugee question on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls on its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the course of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jutta Br@@ eit was really interested in getting a dog .
this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now grew up in the form of another business loc@@ ale .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop vis @-@ à @-@ vis the shop , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has got ro@@ uts from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
to me most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman cannot answer with the last security .
perhaps it &apos;s up to the fact that a nice bag is enhanced every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it is hostile to foreign journalists , concerns journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office boo@@ sts the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fris@@ ur is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del directed a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps , to which besides Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the per@@ imeter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the investors , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian State , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he is pol@@ ed , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pension count@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz came to a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president isn &apos;t it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , which has been inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cin@@ ders , also in the USA are awak@@ ened interest .
the Upper Bavarian Municip@@ ality of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the German Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for Today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the Federal Capital of Germany when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise posted an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , compared with today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
in August , Today achieved an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September , sunrise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect that dawn more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ary of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle on New Zealand &apos;s coast with his two children reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , revealed an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that it didn &apos;t manage to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who the bach@@ el@@ or wins .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was en@@ sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both knew both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; she added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the bach@@ el@@ or will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula encouraged Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his p@@ atz@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , one only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and keeps an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ ag@@ ram .
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of gay men

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn retreat in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt in front of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers to the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; Ai@@ van@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get ship@@ yards in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Spe@@ akers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets up to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as did it during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free vot@@ er as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ van@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need national standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country &apos;s country policy should not fall under the table in a large @-@ walled city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long @-@ standing long @-@ standing burner remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the secondary school of three to four years will be tested .
but that does not go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools that want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

as a result , investors presented little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in future wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were removed than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber shells on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shells into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , chief executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before they attacked rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber shells , of which it is known that they can kill , but they traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ator voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Center Alte Post is to be built again .
the city currently prepares everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meters area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The City of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Old Post &apos;s youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor issue is not yet clear .
no agreements have been concluded either .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner of the Big Street , already purchased a few months ago and the building can be torn down on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure cycle
months had been negotiated , gri@@ eved , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the small seaside near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
for months , the project has been discussing the roughly ten to twelve million euros in the discussion .
severe reactions among land@@ lords who came to the meeting caused the images and new details to the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the sea bu@@ d owner and member of the board member at the representation of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ one that overlooks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus inv@@ itations will have to come so that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling fund campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google , Inc . ( Goo@@ gl ) announced a dou@@ bling fund that is to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees rolling over the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to publi@@ ci@@ zing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Fron@@ tiers , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / came to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes following weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ e operations have proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been conducted in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I under those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments almost equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes illness dissolved completely and at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely eliminated only at one percent and in some cases with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the leader researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ ent@@ omy group ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater set@@ backs in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide urged them to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which de@@ votes himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be dimin@@ ished in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
toxic control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ infection agents in children under 12 years who report poison control centres reported from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ infection agents drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold prescribed by an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah all@@ u@@ ded her words and was not able to walk as she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of Hir@@ n trauma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection clo@@ ths and store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
besides alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a mort@@ al solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the ver@@ ei@@ tel@@ ed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

od@@ ors : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the Ho@@ ops are in a bad place , but that he will turn it again .
Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation , and War@@ bur@@ ton must be cau@@ tious in January new obligations that could destroy the unit of the vessel
D@@ ons increase lead by Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about dis@@ cord
there are rum@@ ors about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Celtic fighting , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following expul@@ sion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points lead , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel exactly the same - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he hur@@ ried a few January transfers , R@@ angers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ces and insist@@ ing that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not managed the finish of Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defender was cancelled later - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and ins@@ ist : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have a song sung with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident happened in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le when it doesn &apos;t play Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ber@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but it is said that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league win which brought them a lead of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in po@@ ised games or le@@ agues that won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom there is a total increase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.3 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ es the process
as the security guards failed to make peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pe@@ pper@@ y spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breathing alcohol test yiel@@ ded 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le at a 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and initially remained in custody .
why I am witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , a more mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ commodity , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked about the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace incident in pel@@ vic ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to float across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing sports
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ er sample at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months for the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging bun@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had allowed the bomb to go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; before eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people are thinking outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say now let them think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainers &quot; fru@@ stration levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been the same yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with packing on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy back against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fight back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark about the Storm Team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ering of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tiques of two leading trainers to his team confirm him confi@@ dently , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson replied about ring@@ struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed our defensive system or techniques . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tical a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this time comes up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm Team is free at this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who might face a life @-@ long punishment for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 b@@ ail .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long penalty for attempting to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of criminal offen@@ se , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in common to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ lu@@ ent declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damage , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , reports on the police every day and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab is torn apart
during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left in the last moment , as the police shared .
the driver &apos;s cab suspen@@ ds completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from 6 hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of continuous pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computer found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for im@@ pending images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the im@@ pending pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the duty of the In@@ dict@@ ment to have taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of this year to have viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear before the court hearing on 24 March this year .
defence attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael wa@@ its the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual crimes .
drag @-@ user switches to Germany from small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up at the German @-@ Austrian border , away from the major control points .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people from fear of discovery and arrest more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Land@@ kreise ( Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn ) since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ubs to the German side .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registry .
according to the Federal Police Head@@ quarters , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
at 8 : 00 AM alone , some 700 people had arrived at the provincial capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : off@@ shoots of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ ks in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the foo@@ th@@ ill of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the past few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground sea rice with arches from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun rose again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the cars show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all moving to the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel presents a start @-@ up below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ essi@@ ans also offer additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door Opel Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan install@@ ment wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Newton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented their hand at the front end . here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI are also available .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Federal Court of Justice Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were confined within a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility in Berlin between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now again on the free foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his office of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court rev@@ oked the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , a compensation was given , it was called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a disgu@@ ise of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money indem@@ ni@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they spoke only in April to a prisoner of ad@@ moni@@ tion , because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , man @-@ un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommodated three months a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ ckets it should already have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial system , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do in Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the unusual challenge , German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) Apartments are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as before ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social flats are out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable flats will also apply for refugees .
the Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to be built and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
both scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that long @-@ term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education , critic@@ ises the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to the recognition of work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation , which restric@@ ts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , it is mostly the point of view that refugees should be facilit@@ ated more quickly to access the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ än@@ hardt from the Königs@@ weg for Work Integration .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few refugees give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators rising strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared for lessons without knowledge of German .
but they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ acker from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence or debt do not get any benefits after the asylum application law more if they start a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter are basically not a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to bear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ af@@ ö@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this gap to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must also be closed , ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively entr@@ ust Islam to the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ law to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ religion relationship .
the founding of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , would also be important .
the rights also belong to duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to address religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ ge such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will continue to be a topic all over society in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will also have to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism becomes more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organizations and stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans call for a long time and which international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany must become reality in the coming years , when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that are expected so far , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand in the registration of health cards .
services rendered could later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited range of services provided by the asylum application law .
apart from that , the doctors mainly do the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are po@@ orer informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees , however , have already been helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , there are much more untreated han@@ di@@ caps in the refugee camps , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ enlightenment .
with the partly other disease pictures German doctors would come from their education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of health , even allevi@@ ation may be seen by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and , if possible , take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill based on estimates by the Bundes@@ Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable are refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who suffers from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death fears .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration difficulties , strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill , asylum seek@@ ers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sur@@ es and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on a brick .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ cker and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
the gift for am@@ ate@@ urs is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cub@@ an duo wants to take up loos@@ ely .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and dex@@ ter@@ ity .
balance the wheel on a ball ?
for He y@@ uan no problem .
snake people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problems in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us too . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on its zeb@@ roid @-@ jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 : 00 p.m .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video footage spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ weiler .
last month , they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard will probably disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today is , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to establish electro @-@ installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to address the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused businesses provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 League games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a prone period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns out to be a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to indul@@ ge in a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ i@@ dating effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched during the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever since , how suicide rates among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided by social media , with their emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during the football look in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely get involved , even though they often with@@ hold themselves to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telephone care I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and hom@@ icide @-@ risk , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know which difference your friendship might make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts di Maria met as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head @-@ ball@@ ast in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend was a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was sto@@ op@@ ed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was designated as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before passing Johan Wil@@ and passing beautiful into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which struck Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes appeared , with some false che@@ eses and bad conclusions , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half after only five attempts and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern apparently stood in front of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for the FC Barcelona a few years ago .
eight times Spanish champion , three times championship winner , four times champion league winner , twice world champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he stood before the European Championship in 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to have Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi hasn &apos;t changed
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the grass , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph .
matt Dam@@ on presents diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with imp@@ ec@@ cable dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian were captiv@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the Social Media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement posted a nation @-@ wide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against bul@@ lying .
in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ wers who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , it is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished her 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the ti@@ ring phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I never deserved more than 10,000 $ or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E. over his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it gets the grand pri@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think that he won any gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad R@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ ring every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ ring , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three rounds in the back meeting at the end of the seventh session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran over the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped a Two @-@ Run to the right @-@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play
when Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth session , Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , st@@ acked S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game by an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than one month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers arrived in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t sm@@ ash particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ ow@@ ls .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder @-@ break , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP announced Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start beating the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
only in the last ten days , according to the government pres@@ idency , responsible for the first recording , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military actions in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he designed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ective Look &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , after Hungary , nobody will be sent back .
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee traffi@@ cking in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial pick @-@ up and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the Länder , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , complain this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective could not stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now overcome a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence .

Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asive routes through Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants are on their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spatial probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon stag@@ gers easily on its orbit around the Ring Plan@@ ets .
although this motion is only small , but still too large for a solid heavenly body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the roof of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds 2006 , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and iron particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole it must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must abst@@ ain from offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a united professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive stat@@ es@@ man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Kro@@ ate currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the peel @-@ color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

first F@@ öh@@ n@@ sturm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , the valleys of the Alps of the F@@ öh@@ n erup@@ ts , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the valleys .
after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind bu@@ cks and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ print area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the alpine side , on the night , on Wednesday , the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
in the consequence , the F@@ öh@@ n blows up to Thursday morning in the valleys with arches from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ bu@@ ys of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my gro@@ aning ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the mountain slope .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , a total of over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , this has already fallen large amounts of rainf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow goes out , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east across Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind refres@@ hes strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , on the other hand it will be sunny on the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome just next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing had been applied by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith over centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a comm@@ enting sin @-@ b@@ abel .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment , Luther took the division of the Western Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , it can seem quite d@@ ü@@ ster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ land .
with this he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publisher with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the Bibli@@ cal passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , in current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry clasp has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education took place already with the pi@@ pelines , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on that to bring me back to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to make art more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of ima@@ gery is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt now wants the viewer to &quot; go &quot; into the pictures , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I have not paid attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but the most important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture Bible was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ rail seam
plans made , space found , company mand@@ ated to model Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already an end .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hills moved up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will take place in October , the first community expert Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate with the Child and Youth Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga will give a clear indication on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign if they will carry the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsorship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that all should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport boss Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matter of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees is going on for everyone , nobody can ignore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football feder@@ ates , no , we have to use our jet power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the Euro qualifying match against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have started their own projects is great .
equally great is that small and smallest clubs are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and the next year , the association jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government provides 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , impot@@ ent , has then thrown out onto the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Som@@ e@@ thing can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem size on the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change in the position of the door .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of master keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all Europe League matches , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open .
with high probability he will also ride the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ spiel@@ Re@@ us that the final suit for the BV@@ B must be the target for the BV@@ B in the Europa League is understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot &apos;s cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of car after the will of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday to adopt a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the IAA in Frankfurt on Wednesday in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not be brus@@ hed out additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the person as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more for the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads should be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany location estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly determined .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
on Wednesday , a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent will only count in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 , with autonomous driving cars , accounts for 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over all the roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could mean at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who initi@@ ates the mailing list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth One . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins that look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung on September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejected attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you enter the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canada &apos;s Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ thei@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it concerns tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excellent choreograph@@ ed overall artwork for which a lot of effort was carried out : to fr@@ o the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have lost 14 tons of material .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ inous fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it naturally .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers , for example , for blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vable P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and with regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic eras , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ vable P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialty shops and also wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products do not yet reach our customers in this way .
nowadays , mass production is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively through chains .
moreover , exports are weaker , currently in Russia and in the US .
so there are plenty of reasons for new paths .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger exterior of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies , who have to think of everything economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
the machine sti@@ cking small chi@@ cks at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want a reminder .
with this I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ tern tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not a re @-@ film but a kind of continuation that takes 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already stands firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was assigned to the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promote private capital , and over@@ haul the population register system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a far @-@ right state business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus to exploit the consumer a much higher dose of the ne@@ ural currency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; are to be raised by one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ or fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limits , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch called this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of cl@@ ots is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is highly enriched by the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the maximum allow@@ ances , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily absorbed by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power stations are expelled more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and widespread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
