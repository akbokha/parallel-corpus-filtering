if the community , the states or persons subject to their authority , however extraordinary costs as a result of a special seeking of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs insofar as it has addressed itself in advance .
in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way apply as to the nationals of the states .
any claim that the Community or a State against the Organization or the Organisation vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or the State because of any damage , except for damage from a nuclear incident , which resulted from the implementation of the safegu@@ ards following this Convention , is regulated in accordance with international law .
if the Council after examination of the relevant information provided by the Director General determines that the organisation is not in a position to verify that no core material , which must be subject to security measures after this Convention , has been cut off for nuclear weapons or other nuclear bla@@ sting bodies , he can also take the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such a case , the Council takes into consideration the extent to which measures were acquired by the applied safety measures and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the Organization , Community or State , consultations on questions arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to take part in discussing such questions by the Council .
with the exception of any dispute arising from an assessment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any action adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another procedure agreed by the organization , the Community and the States shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ration court , which consists of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states name two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two refer@@ ees , and the four arbitr@@ ator appointed will choose a fifth presi@@ ding seat .
if the Community and the states or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ator within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the organization may seek to ap@@ point the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these refer@@ ees .
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbit@@ er has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention enters into force for non @-@ core states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention .
( II ) if the community of the organisation noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its safegu@@ ards to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other on the request of one of the contracting parties on a change of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization of any change in this Agreement .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to set the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on security measures .
the objective of the safegu@@ arding measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bla@@ sting bodies for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a dis@@ junction by the risk of early detection .
in order to reach the target set in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important additional measures .
the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the amount of material that is not shown for a specific period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization makes for articles 3 full use of the securing system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the core material community in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their safety precau@@ tions , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures will make use of the following ways and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock@@ pil@@ es ;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ating measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accumulation of un@@ measured assets and loss of measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the core fuel circuit described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , thus the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) Le@@ aves the core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or is the core material produced in the states at a later stage of the core fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the association is temporarily not possible or desired , so consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention will be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community can recognize that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on the request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in gram - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) the core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
on the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of the core material delivered in the states in the States at no time is more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Uran@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature reserve , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of his weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liberated core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with the core material subject to this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on the material .
the community coinci@@ des with the Organisation Supp@@ le@@ mentary ab@@ lation , which is necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures established in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or altered without amend@@ ment of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period demands the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report cited in Article 62 , the organization provides a summary inventory of the core material underlying the security measures contained in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory on account of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special interaction program established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire input provided by the Member States will be bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds raised by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement to the Special Trade Rep@@ osit@@ ory ; this account is used by the organization as administrator and used ( in this capacity the organization is herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the Member State , which are to be paid on request in the currency of the concerned state in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the location of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the order within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans .
C ) Any Member State may , upon request , make payments before the aforementioned dates .
the car@@ et@@ aker takes approximately proportional draws on the cash or the Notes in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction account appropriately .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ advantageous ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly re@@ pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , in accordance with the procedures and practices that will be considered for the purpose of the ple@@ bis@@ c@@ ality referred to in this agreement under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble .
the funds of the special transaction bank may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which have already been approved by the directors of the bank or the organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special action loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions granted to the organization granted for the organization ; therefore , they are pay@@ able in 50 years at ten free years .
transaction Lo@@ ans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that keeps it in place .
any special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds indicated .

capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
the ste@@ ward will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC until the complete allocation of all special transaction loan to the E@@ EC via the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation and through the projects approved by the directors .
during the time of the pa@@ yout of the special transaction loan , the administrator provides the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses for this .
as soon as possible , the administrator tran@@ sm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC tran@@ sm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the account notes , and the amounts paid in the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete edition of the means of the special transaction account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of programs or plans financed by special actions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may possibly agree , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from are due to the parties with immediate effect .
if the total capital amount paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations arising from it are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States note the conclusion of the proceedings concerning the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat shall forward these noti@@ fications together with a notification of the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement is effective and comes into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the stated noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is translated into two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding being equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be en@@ acted :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a common company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Tre@@ aties - herein@@ after called &quot; Common Enterprise J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been working on research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since extensive work is still to be carried out until the practical use of controlled fusion processes , it is in the interests of the contracting parties to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research work , which have achieved a higher priority due to the energy crisis -
this agreement should enable every party of the contracting party to benefit from the greatest benefits provided by a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physi@@ k , and consequently to achieve the common goal of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled key fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it is thus extended or altered after the examination by the organs mentioned in articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities that are relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the parties agree to adopt a new program , this will take place in the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the Association shall be realized in paragraph 1 by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom countries , in Switzerland and in third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme ;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
with regard to the implementation of the association designated in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties include an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those agreed between the Commission and the states and companies or individuals , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realisation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland , at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , takes part in the transfer of the human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s joint venture with the time of entry into force , whose by@@ laws it accepts .
furthermore Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is subject to any contract whose goal falls within the scope of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement .
the organs responsible for carrying out the association designated in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement .
in particular , the association agreement fores@@ ees the implementation of a steering committee , which includes the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research work and to ensure that best results are achieved in line with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - referred to in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it particularly promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination among associated organs and aims at strengthening its T * iness in the interests of the two contracting parties on the common goal established in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss programme and on the common goal established in Article 1 of the present agreement , with which the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into consideration .
pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the counselling groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the appropriate Swiss authorities are seeking .
the advis@@ ers that submit to the VG research proposals with regard to the fact that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this responsibility seriously with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .

if such a further program decision arises , the extension for the duration of the new programme that occurs in the place of the Eur@@ atom programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I shall not be termin@@ ated unless it comes to delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom programme .

I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force January 1 , 1978 .
I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of your government to the above .
I honor me to confirm you the receipt of your current letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks issue a corresponding proposal .
the agreement could be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ ices ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery charge funds of the member countries .
even now , however , some conditions have been mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years .
in the event of the opening of the loans , as well as with the possible extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made prior to exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement at the disposal , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be dealt with considering the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S used at the time in similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin of the Libor .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I commend myself to share with you the approval of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and Lamm@@ f@@ ums
I commend myself to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set up provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina requires appropriate procedures to ensure that the quantity of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and / is executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the above @-@ mentioned committee to find an appropriate solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the Community uses the safeguard clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the community market is not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned .
the Community ple@@ dges to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ist set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
with the entry of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount set under number 2 according to the volume of Argent@@ ine trade with every new Member State .
the import duty for these new Member States shall be set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will take account of the ho@@ ist set stated in number 5 .
the total amount referred to in number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed volumes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the community makes provisions so that the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance on the sale of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for export of lamb and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be awarded to prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ cen@@ tive and Trade Agreement .
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular by giving export lic@@ ences for the products named under number 1 within the agreement set out in this agreement .
in turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is subject to origin in Argentina on the basis of an export lic@@ ences , issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license may be wai@@ ved .
in terms of implementing regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community for@@ ks in regular intervals the quantities that have been issued for export lic@@ ences ; these details may , if necessary , be de@@ cryp@@ ted to country of destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and will work smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he regularly reviews the Ten@@ dency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified in number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not named after the Community .
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement are subject to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 .
the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before the 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary for necessary .
I would be grateful if you would share with us the approval of your government .
I honor me to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I am referring to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honour to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will ensure H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Zealand maintains the assurance that the normal sales of his H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb are not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the quantity of the annual estimated annual amount does not exceed the set amount .
the specified quantities are executed in conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ensures that New Zealand will not be prevented from using this agreement to take advantage of new technological developments or maintain its competitive position in the community market .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the above @-@ mentioned committee in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community uses the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand arising from this agreement .
in case the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the Community ple@@ dges to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ist set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities established in Clau@@ se 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trading with each new Member State .
the import duty for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case the ho@@ ist set in clause 5 shall be taken into account .
the total amount stated in clause 2 will be set up with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 2@@ 45 500 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed volumes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community is making arrangements so that the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation of this objective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ lei@@ sch in the community without any risk for market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for export of lamb and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be awarded to prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand reserves the right to comply with the amounts stated in clause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities .
in turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is subject to origin in New Zealand from the submission of an export lic@@ ences , issued by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license may be wai@@ ved .

a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appearances may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly th@@ inning the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of most powerful serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the blood @-@ body coating in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other agents that are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood type determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at present standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in certain preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te coating .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood type determination , available for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown re@@ agent compared to the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a Stat@@ utory Health Care Unit in International Units ( see Bulletin Board O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you put them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B s@@ ling contain 256 international units per ml .
preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens serum Institute , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation attempts ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ heated serum .
re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents prescribed for the international exchange should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least not until an international agreement has come about through a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may possibly be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records on all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents to determine blood type determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents spent are so long to be stored by the laboratory until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion ; others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their effective proportion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black @-@ and @-@ white label must be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,

the contractual parties DI@@ ES@@ ES Convention , which has been elabor@@ ated under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the Council for cooperation in the territory of the customs system -
in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH to make it easier to grasp , compare and evaluate statistical data , particularly those of international trade ,
in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH to lower the costs resulting from the fact that in international trade , goods have to be re @-@ defined and re @-@ en@@ coded in the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of trade documents and the transmission of data ,
in the calculation that the development of technology and structures of international trade requires significant changes to the Brussels Treaty of 15 December 1950 over the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff scheme for the introduction of goods to customs tari@@ ffs ,
furthermore , IN DER discretion , that the level of differentiation , demanded by the governments and the economy for duty @-@ based and statistical purposes , is currently far beyond the one contained in the system to the aforementioned agreement ,
in the calculation that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations ,
in the calculation that the harmon@@ ized system should be used for the freight rates and traffic statistics of different modes of transport ,
in the calculation that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included as far as possible into the systems used in the trade for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods ,
in the weighing that the harmon@@ ised system should help to establish a close relationship between import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN DER discretion that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ized system and the international commodity directory for the foreign trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations should be maintained ,
in the calculation that it is desirable to meet the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff and statistics system which is appropri@@ ated for the use by the international trade involved ,
recognizing that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and structures of international trade ,
taking into account the work undertaken by the Council for cooperation in the territory of the customs system for the harmon@@ ised system in this area ,
in the weighing that - although the aforementioned agreement on the tari@@ ff scheme has proved to be an effective instrument to achieve some of these objectives - the conclusion of a new international convention is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result -
in the sense of this convention , a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the identification and codi@@ fication of goods , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; harmon@@ ised system , &quot; consisting of positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from the notes to sections . chapters and sub @-@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ized system ;

the parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the Custom@@ s Area Area
it is desirable that the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the identification and codi@@ fication of the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 in Brussels is desirable .
in the weighing that without a change in Article 13 of the above Convention would continue to remain uncertain in the time of the entry into force of this Convention -
in Article 13 of the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for Desig@@ ning and Co@@ ating the Goo@@ ds , which was concluded in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; paragraph 1 receives as follows :

under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that from its cultivation depend on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which in turn depends entirely on the measures that are made to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ producing consumer countries ;
in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that olive oil and mes@@ oli@@ ven are essential ingredients in the areas in which olive growing is common ;

in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that this causes all the particular difficulties which seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and may end@@ anger the general policies of economic growth in countries that are in zones where olive growing is common ;
under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F , the extraordinary importance of olive production for the economy of numerous countries , in particular the olive growing countries in development ;
with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that , given the particular circumstances of olive growing and the market for olive products , measures must go beyond the national sphere and that international action is essential ;
