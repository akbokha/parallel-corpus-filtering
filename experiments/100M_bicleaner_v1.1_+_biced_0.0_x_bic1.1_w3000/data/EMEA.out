this document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you require further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ ren thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental disorder where patients alternate man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high @-@ mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution can be used to take in or the melt tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time taking A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole supposedly works primarily as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin have a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder leading to increased un@@ rest , compared with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the patient &apos;s symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution for intake ( recording ) .
in the two trials of the injection solution patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving placebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies decreased man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest even more effectively than placebo and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled strain ) , trem@@ bling , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( di@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , vomiting , nausea , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for placing A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were referred to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
given the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is de@@ composed of combination therapy , the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ense for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ o@@ cel@@ i@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored in relation to worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ acting drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % whereas the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be undertaken .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metaboli@@ zers may result in joint use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers .
considering the common application of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be undertaken .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ysts / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ z@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ysts ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and the concerns raised in the reproduction studies of the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were reported more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study lasting more than 52 weeks , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ alie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l &apos;s treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ole treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of those treated with placebo .
side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence as reported in the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute dos@@ ages with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose is beneficial as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ es and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ t .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg - depression @-@ rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ cone @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &quot; weight gain &quot; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 % ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a versus placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly did not refer to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se to the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ li@@ zation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metaboli@@ zers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a post @-@ specific pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mid @-@ steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose .

bi@@ polar disorder episodes - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ cone @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &quot; weight gain &quot; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 % ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a comparative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the drug used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melt tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ole inj@@ ections are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescri@@ p@@ tions or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ense for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ o@@ cel@@ i@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and indications of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored in relation to worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
however , the intensity of se@@ d@@ se@@ dation was greater compared with the one @-@ time addition of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in a study where healthy volunteers received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as a single dosage intra@@ muscular and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers can result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be undertaken .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that of the sole dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ole injection solution compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of those treated with placebo .
side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence as reported in the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the mean improvement from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression @-@ scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher decline in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ cone @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &quot; weight gain &quot; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 % ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly did not refer to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se to the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ following repeated dose during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 - and 5 @-@ times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after an intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the moderate @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel chemotherapy .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel chemotherapy .
it may also not be used in patients who are still in the blood or have low blood pressure before the treatment begins .
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and that unlike other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel medications , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 the European Commission granted the Company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ x number &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy in the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until the improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of c@@ anned adaptation in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data to recommend dosage adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to inadequate data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other types of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
no renewed treatment cycles should be initiated in the patients until the number of patients has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity which is clearly related to Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case patients receive nausea , vomiting , and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic agents and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable seal method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treating via a blocking account , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can impact immunity and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy have occurred in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ to@@ ase hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stool , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , abdominal pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al correlation with these events was established .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a timi@@ d mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the mat@@ ur@@ ation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ sation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ f@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and , as part of in @-@ vitro studies , it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in supports the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel with endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ doc@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ ination receptor and a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the tumor area due to the alb@@ um@@ ble protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a 3 @-@ week mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , either in form of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % for metastatic disease and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposition of active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 . the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arity distribution and / or width binding of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane using the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection , the clearing of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) than after solvent @-@ based pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro and tissue layers , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for the un@@ altered amount of active ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic agent and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when handling Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , the sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute to a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the punch bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then rinse the punch bottle slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or be inver@@ ted until full full suspension of the powder is done .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medical drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if self @-@ bleeding is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to have a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be done by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is inserted which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was used as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared to the refer@@ ee drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least 8 weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of stre@@ amed skin stre@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained by patients who were switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed to the same extent as those patients who continue receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
un@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed the European Union has provided evidence that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces un@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the placing stre@@ amed in the European Union .

ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed over or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in inv@@ ari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest licensed dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher retention doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher retention doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - following symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in inv@@ ari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest licensed dose required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of reactions of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the starting point , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increases &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of the number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is increased three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of antibodies by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l relative to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , where the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , Ab@@ y@@ amed should receive a total dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the onset of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
on this occasion , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each on 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the tube and ensure sufficient injection of the drug to the circulation .
patients who develop a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) under treatment should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ p@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of low ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
for patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , secondary arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the kar@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ block@@ ade ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ex up to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with an increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the threshold cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the reaction loc@@ y@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the plat@@ el@@ ets and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row can be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epo@@ et@@ ine when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the an@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of hypertension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ fied coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who need to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the h@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on benefits @-@ risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative thro@@ mbo@@ sis / vascular events may exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , isch@@ em@@ ic thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm , re@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ di@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides and , in terms of amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate percentage , is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumors , 22 gastro@@ intestinal cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patient .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls in the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value less than 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than the serum levels that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced overall weight , ret@@ arded oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality in animal experimental studies involving nearly 20 times the recommended daily dose .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of in@@ secure significance for the clinical situation .

141 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
143 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of hypertension .

prior to market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the holder of approval for placing the medicine in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies will provide the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging .
the owner of the authorisation for placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is set up and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine used in the transport is applied .
the owner of the authorisation for placing on the market comm@@ its itself to the trials listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and , according to each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan , adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided simultaneously with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • receiving new information which may affect the current safety specification , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction )
• Have suffered a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of blood cl@@ at@@ rop@@ y in veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred before you .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with un@@ se@@ amed it can lead to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range .
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests if necessary to control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
lack of iron , the dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the beginning of the treatment .
very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ genic ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin moul@@ ded ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you are suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled .
therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in is the risk for problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically exposed coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or shr@@ ink@@ age due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which has not yet been di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in case you are cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed works like a growth factor for blood cells and may adver@@ sely affect the tumor .
if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the start of treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get rid of Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / apply / used until recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure the drug works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of stre@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and make sure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ atter Ab@@ y@@ amed himself underneath the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( swelling @-@ ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , hot feeling and faster pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ block@@ ade means that no longer sufficient red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see the section called &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can - irrespective of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - come to a blood cul@@ turing ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood cl@@ umping after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or if you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or be disc@@ arded .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a little trau@@ matic her@@ nia as during the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material was used for Z@@ omet@@ a to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate for six months .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75 % compared with the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those who received placebo .
compared to those in Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 out of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
do not use Ac@@ la@@ sta in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to cel@@ ol@@ ei@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reaction to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta producer provides information for physicians to prescri@@ be the Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how the medicine is to be applied , and a similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
April 2005 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for placing Ac@@ la@@ sta throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ tures .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tract contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast @-@ feeding women • Requi@@ rement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing help
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , correspon@@ dingly twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) For Pati@@ ents with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop because of the rapid implementation of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , correspon@@ dingly twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( bad oral hygiene ) should undergo a dental examination with appropriate pre @-@ venti@@ l@@ ated dental treatment prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients need@@ ing dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney Dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ de was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis more than three years comparable between the placebo and placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days of the treatment was observed in 1.8 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of those treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies compared to 21 % .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently reported hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been occasionally treated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with an Ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering or@@ ally calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk for spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire th@@ ig@@ h by 6.0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the retention of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture in the case of Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to placebo .
bone turnover markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ alities were 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison with placebo treatment increased BM@@ D at the total air and th@@ ig@@ h neck at all times .
compared to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta therapy led to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % at the end of the chain .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , once weekly , Ac@@ la@@ sta did not submit an annual dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate relative to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was evaluated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly mild to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , in a mean period of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of cit@@ ric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ ci@@ ally independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly reduced to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance of the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ A 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long exclusion period with a terminal elim@@ inary cycle time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is primarily tied to bone tissue .
the total body clearance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
decreased Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely to be metaboli@@ zed because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the cy@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min .
since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) contains only limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ mineral @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C were 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which is equivalent to 6 @-@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , performed toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common finding in repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and skel@@ etal ab@@ norm@@ alities .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits despite the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum @-@ calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application is and works before and while the product is marketed .
Ris@@ ko management plan The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market requires the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance to be carried out in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan of the adopted version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the approval application and of the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached .
bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone reconstruction happens too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces strength to the bones .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you are using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / apply / have recently taken / applied even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you should be concerned that you have sufficient fluid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if you missed the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or craw@@ ling or num@@ b@@ bling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions right up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , the patient must be sufficiently hydr@@ ated ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can develop because of the rapid implementation of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500@@ mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
according to obesity ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or , respectively , overweight people ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) are also overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or more ) and more
in addition , four studies were carried out to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which according to the placebo application , A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking .
the studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
the most common adverse events associated with A@@ compli@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , lead to a small minority of patients receiving su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is advisable with concur@@ rent use of drug with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ tist my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z
it also contributes to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
compliance is not recommended for the use of children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used for depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who - in addition to obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other nearby individuals ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ etic medicine ) is not shown .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ ate treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes more variable .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ in was examined in triple therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , additionally they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the triple therapy trial , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study evaluating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and an@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for placing Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision on whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on should continue until the laboratory parameters have been submitted to the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ ato@@ cytes by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cytes by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or dual combination therapy with insulin , the risk of high doses @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , was reported with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on
frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on drug interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the elevated insulin resistance of the mother animal in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not available from present data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on AL@@ T asc@@ ents over three times the upper limit of the normal range often occurred as often as under placebo but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced macro@@ vascular disease incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the group treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to be activated by activation of specific nucle@@ i recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated in the animal model for increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had not been sufficiently adjusted despite a three @-@ month improvement phase with insulin were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continue to receive insulin , a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent in comparison to bas@@ eline data was observed .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small 18 week study on Type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d dimin@@ ished values were observed .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only reduce the in@@ timi@@ dation of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ den@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized into groups which received either pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is resor@@ bed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV equ@@ ates to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and at a lower extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and apes concur@@ red with repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia associated with the gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased frequency of colon@@ izing tumours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with either Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent in comparison to bas@@ eline data was observed .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only reduce the in@@ timi@@ dation of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ den@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both with effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to determine its primary end@@ point , which showed a combination of the overall mor@@ ale , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation on the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks showing how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels have been lowered as much as with another human insulin .
acet@@ one should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to ( allergic ) to the human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ate may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the packaging element ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ac@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk a / S a permit for placing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage is required .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to acet@@ ate in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before travelling , which are going through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always after other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however gradually develop : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an assigned assistant or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration amounts up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk a / S a permit for placing Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of rapidly acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which are going through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

clinical study in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar above 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that a 42 % reduction in mortality induced by intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( between the ages of 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( between the ages of 13 and 17 ) .
the data are limited but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pla@@ ques ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger deposits of urine , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
there may still be sei@@ zur@@ es during the first treatment months , so it is recommended that patients take other medicines for preventing rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ drug ) and of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; kidney problems only received 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo was the case .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea , nausea , nausea , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one of the medical history known or currently present and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum resin level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restrictions , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
because there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ ting receivers , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid medicines , acute g@@ out attacks can occur during the treatment , because the lowering of the serum resin table initially mobili@@ ses ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine can in rare cases rise so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before the end of the fa@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment and subsequent clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ Was were not carried out in@@ effective studies on f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous addition of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .

in a study with subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delays and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancy can not be related to side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ ec@@ tomy and / or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at treatment groups in total more than once .
diar@@ rhea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine at the same time . * * In the clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
adverse events reported during long @-@ term publishing studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency :

the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction ch@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → U@@ ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro inhibit@@ ing located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum levels of serum were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x a day as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of serum resin @-@ acid levels to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with functional impair@@ ment The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage response of serum concentration in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
at the beginning of the study , primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open renewal study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin @-@ acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) revealed a decrease in incidence of g@@ out cases , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the nod@@ ules , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out node to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage drop in serum concentration levels was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state @-@ distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent across the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE with regard to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhea ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , wound cavi@@ ties , wound abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic upset .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be applied to o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us disorders , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. company a permit for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only to be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of sho@@ cking irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day@@ time . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , are given special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible adverse reactions , and patients should be advised to dep@@ ose of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take on symptoms which point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was observed , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure decreases the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning of each patient based on an individual benefit / risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE on the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases that affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly detri@@ mental effects regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the intake of serum cal@@ ci@@ um to &lt; 8.@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups occurred with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose may cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and adverse events in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new rate of verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the addition of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( mean increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly re@@ distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10@@ mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance was not 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not believed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

in the case of a dose of radioactive enam@@ elled vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the medium ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the case after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although there are no clinical data about it , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is to be expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ancement is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ ts , with the use of Adv@@ ant@@ al using Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the gra@@ ft was rejected after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or re @-@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , more studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ ant@@ al is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ ancement may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with Adv@@ ance , as the dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time has to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative wor@@ ding , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ al should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ents should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ ancement , to ensure adequate substance exposure during the immediate post @-@ surgical period .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ance dose can take several days before the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral treatment of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
can recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ al , so this conversion has to take place at a rate of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t Fol@@ lowing a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ant@@ l once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients , which are transferred to Adv@@ ant@@ al , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily once in the morning .
other gra@@ ft receiver Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal patients , Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for color@@ ectal cancer patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced h@@ ep@@ atic function To maintain blood signals in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum levels of serum , a calculation of cre@@ atine data and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f When mig@@ rating from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level monitoring .
it is recommended to perform frequent check of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ seb@@ ac@@ eous levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled following conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ancement is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may need several days before the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the seb@@ ac@@ eous levels in the blood exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the upper levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml have been used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in the result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation is available .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed wor@@ ding Adv@@ ancement .
because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ ph can be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required because the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy labeled as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ancement .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ant@@ ages contain hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose , there are special caution in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies revealed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus resulting from the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may interfere with their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduces the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increases hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of examinations in transplan@@ t patients have no indication that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended to possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not precisely identified because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) .

infection and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as is known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , is frequently increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infection ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ancement .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours have been reported in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus cannot be di@@ aly@@ zed .
effective mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ te protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific line of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tok@@ ines .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , 2@@ 1,7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans were compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients treated by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ge et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who were also undergoing a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t , which were random@@ ised to receive tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target range from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after color@@ ectal transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids shall be responsible for the higher clearance install@@ ments observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ancement was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent check of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation is available .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood co@@ agulation disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether lawyers are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is inserted which enables it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
lawyer is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate topical ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under 6 years of age , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ ci@@ odes with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ates may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or witch protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a approval for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II @-@ deficiency , on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma concentrations ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment process , a proper determination of factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the dosage speed should be adjusted according to the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 re@@ position days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ position days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , a re@@ combin@@ ant VI@@ II product was observed to prevent recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there is no experience of the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
A@@ DR &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all previously untreated patients with a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 re@@ position days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE .
in addition , no 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres for these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend and a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE reports on hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of factor X activated by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( bas@@ eline of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

special caution when using A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE is required to inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with factor VI@@ II products , especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors .
these symptoms can be early signs of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic shock that can additionally include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties .
if you are taking other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking other medicines or who have recently taken it , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medicine .
your doctor will calculate your dose of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE ( in international units or I.@@ E. ) depending on your physical condition and body weight , and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding .
patients who develop factor VI@@ II inhibit@@ ors If the expected factor VI@@ II levels are not reached in your plasma with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE or bleeding cannot be controlled , this could be due to the development of factor VI@@ II@@ -
in conjunction with cath@@ eter infections , reduced number of red blood cells , swelling of limbs and joints , prolonged bleeding after removal of a drainage , decreased factor VI@@ II and postoperative ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided to apply for further extension procedures for 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for approval for the placing of Adv@@ ance in the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that links other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) of it .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it does not produce any copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors , allowing cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defect in the human body is normally used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the area of the frac@@ ture , the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours will benefit patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ance can be made in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor to people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified ingredient release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , an allergy to pol@@ len caused by pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ apped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose the patients who received a@@ verages were reported to decrease the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who alone took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received the loss of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart disease ) , oral drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disturbances and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients that are anti @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary retention ( ag@@ grav@@ ated ur@@ ination ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for placing a@@ verages in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have died .
it is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ le@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which are per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ sc@@ ant rhin@@ ologi@@ cs ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ acet@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ h@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not tested for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treating hypertension or a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or increasing headaches ) must be removed .
attention : • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder semi @-@ ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce it to its extent .
in the course of clinical trials involving dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor study showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not stop in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies revealed however no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ lement which may result in impair@@ ment or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S Stim@@ ulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible tablets .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ating mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , prec@@ ur@@ sive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pu@@ pill@@ ary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study involving adults , the 5 mg dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ic antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to patient sub@@ groups defined by gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poorly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , and its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases appear or be diagnosed with you when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • heart disease , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and headache , or strengthening of existing headaches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines When used at the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or decreases the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ ae than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart attack , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves rash and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle aches , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous liver enzymes were also reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg tablet tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup , and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by identifying the changes in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and capacity of the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for the intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in those treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may end after the decay of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed during its recur@@ rence .
if the rh@@ initi@@ s persi@@ sts ( appearance of symptoms 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a continuous treatment can be recommended for patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol intake was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may result in impair@@ ment of mu@@ ti@@ lation or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was headaches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dosage ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of fluid performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks .
as was shown on the basis of the overall score of the questionnaire about quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces stress caused by seasonal aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar regardless of the eti@@ ology of the different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated .
as hist@@ amine exposure is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , except in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the che@@ ating rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of those treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant stimulation after once daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metaboli@@ sm of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data exists which support treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations , and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze lost lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substances ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which have a limited metabolism , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol intake was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dosage ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ic therapy , received a daily bra@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dosage of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years old ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents who were used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor impair@@ ment in adults and adolescents in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol induced alcohol induced loss of alcohol was neither increased nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as was shown on the basis of the overall score of the questionnaire about quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us Tablets effectively reduce those caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restric@@ tive metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that can be impaired .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of a clin@@ ically relevant active substance @-@ cum@@ ulation after once daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the study showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metaboli@@ sm of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III bra@@ id bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dosage ) .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated . this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , the 5 mg dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of fusion tablets once daily put into the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in children under 6 years of age have not yet been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adults .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study involving adults , the 5 mg dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of this poorly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied on pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets aid the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which have a limited metabolism , is identical to those in children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as in the placebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rhea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the approval of the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the use of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ al@@ ous H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a strain of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contained in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system is then able to form more quickly antibodies at a contact with a flu virus of this common trunk .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was separated , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as foreign bodies ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you require further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for taking the capsules , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral drug the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and hence the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was strengthened with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few responded to treatment .
in the trial with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are broken down as well as A@@ gener@@ ase and are health @-@ damaging in high blood concentrations .
as with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the recovery of the immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risk of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the re@@ jects found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because for scientific reasons only limited information was published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited Company a permit for placing as@@ generations within the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generative capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ generative capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ generations in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data for safety and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders at 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic lati@@ tude and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 is@@ o@@ en@@ cy@@ c@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , as@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an concur@@ rent administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , ast@@ er@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentrations of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored to ob@@ st@@ inate symptoms , especially if also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ gen content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the onset of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing type of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ts , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were especially reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 is@@ o@@ cy@@ c@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose agents are primarily metaboli@@ zed above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma concentrations by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already uses St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ra below ) .
50@@ 8 % increase , however , for C@@ MA@@ X reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % ab@@ duc@@ ts when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the plas@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma treated with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed to use A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but because of the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ ed component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ generations are at least an hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , because Del@@ a@@ virus may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dosage , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ x compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ast@@ er@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can cause resor@@ ption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degradation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma concentrations .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ us , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with concur@@ rent administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ generations may not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to be careful with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored to ob@@ st@@ inate symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is no recommendation that the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with concur@@ rent administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the no@@ od@@ ine to the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight during breast @-@ feeding .
the further development of descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early on and rarely resulted in a break in the treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of ast@@ er@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ tations and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) occurring in the treatment are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and minor sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ eal fat accumulation .
113 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks were observed only one case ( bull@@ pen ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study Pro@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ inous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be termin@@ ated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is indicated on signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral genetic and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ prec@@ ur@@ sors with the result of an un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r allo@@ yed treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 50@@ V , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at treatment beginning and another against ti@@ rel@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early dis@@ continuation of a treatment is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI treated pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the virus load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ inf@@ low threshold of 0.4 lo@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was dos@@ ed twice daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s that were administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increase , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by food intake , although simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 @-@ l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to the tissue by a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream .
this change results in a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the ste@@ alth state across the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 respectively , respectively , inhi@@ bit or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with as@@ generations ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those that are obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in male animals occurred in doses that were 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ational tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies for juven@@ iles treated with 4 days of age showed high mortality in both the control and am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r animals .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , however , for C@@ MA@@ X reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the plas@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma treated with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ us , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with concur@@ rent administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the concur@@ rent administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a 22 % decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the no@@ od@@ ine to the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast @-@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is indicated on signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the ste@@ alth state across the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 respectively , respectively , inhi@@ bit or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with as@@ generations ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the impact of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in male animals occurred at dos@@ ages corresponding to 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data in humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , bacterial reverse mut@@ ational tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies for juven@@ iles treated with 4 days of age showed high mortality in both the control and am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r animals .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase Solution to take into account is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not covered in patients with PI in pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generative capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ ation ly@@ col@@ um , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV from sending HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be de@@ activated in the long run if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , however , for C@@ MA@@ X reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected to be significantly higher after oral dosing by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account may not be applied during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the no@@ od@@ ine to the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during breast @-@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r allo@@ yed treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
premature termination of a dis@@ sent@@ ing 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be taken into account when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 @-@ l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to the tissue by a large c@@ ous@@ el volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream .

your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to use ast@@ er@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of ag@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned diseases or taking any of the above medications .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ generative capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure you have read the information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully before starting treatment .
there are also no sufficient information to recommend the use of ast@@ er@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to improve ampli@@ fication of children between the ages of 4 and 12 or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;

before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered onto the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with total healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete tumour healing after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immuno@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream continues until all visible genital or perio@@ dicals disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are completely healed , another therapy should be initiated ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and filed in the puri@@ fied , with cow@@ war@@ ts infected skin area until the cream is fully covered .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ con@@ dom gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a nar@@ rowing leading to circumc@@ ision .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher doses than recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation has also been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external disposi@@ tions in the genital and perio@@ dicals area , no clinical experience has been found .
limited data suggest an increased rate of ti@@ lt @-@ reduction in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions appear after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ fic@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is present in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of previously untreated melan@@ oma is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or lip area within the lip .
there are very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normal@@ y decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause a lot of discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial revealed that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed less complete healing rates than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , we@@ aving or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable level of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be quanti@@ fied either once or after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given for use during breast@@ feeding .
the most frequently shared and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the location of the treatment of the cow@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine ) .
among the most frequently reported and as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study in phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine ) .
the side effects indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials involving three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream often came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / leaves / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the study plan , evaluating the clinical signs showed that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream were very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe shot formation and sales ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of the alpha interference and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete eradic@@ ation of the war@@ ts in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior .
at 60 % of the patients who had been treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine patients completely healed the war@@ ts ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in five @-@ colour application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine three times a week in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a con@@ jun@@ c@@ tive 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fic@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be demonstrated in these studies at the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three @-@ week application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml on the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin was low from 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application carried out four months also yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours to the application .
the mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk to the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the anti @-@ oxid@@ ant cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people even if these have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● cow@@ war@@ ts ( con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● surface bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
if left untreated , it may lead to ab@@ norm@@ alities , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are rough areas of the skin that occur in people exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lifetime .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in flat @-@ ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , or the virus responsible for infection with cow@@ war@@ ts .
O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations previously , please inform your doctor about this before starting with the treatment . if you have problems with your immune system , consult Al@@ dar@@ a Cream only if the area to be treated is cured after a previous medication or surgical treatment .
in case of accidental contact , remove the cream through rinse with water . don &apos;t use more cream as your doctor prescribed you . o cover the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not with a band@@ age or band@@ . o If reactions occur at the treated place that will give you severe in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water .
once the reactions are gone , you can continue the treatment . inform your doctor if they don &apos;t have a normal blood count
if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty in with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin can be expected with increased incidence of pre @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival swelling .
do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) .
taking other medicines will have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have sex during the infection with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) must be carried out .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently used it , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medicine .
breast@@ feeding your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is not known , as it is not known whether i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine is transferred into breast milk .
the frequency and duration of the treatment are different at til@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream on the clean dry skin area with the war@@ ts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully covered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; men with genital war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area below ( see section 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
for 6 weeks , 5 days a week leave a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist about it immediately if you do not feel well during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause a blue stain to occur in you sooner or it can cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
in addition , you may feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions , which end up in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been dis@@ continued .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , der@@ mati@@ tis , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , heat feeling or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , nas@@ al swelling , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , redness , swelling , ul@@ cers , body aches , fever , weakness or shi@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerve ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines before administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect in reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in extre@@ mi@@ ties ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients less than five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated rate of heart ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that may be disclosed each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient is able to tolerate this , can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which res@@ ett@@ lement facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase III trial , nearly all patients have Ig@@ G antibodies to form Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
there is little experience with regard to resum@@ ing treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , caution must be taken .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ka ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to a decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular in@@ takes of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , which include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
as there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following abund@@ ances : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ induced involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and face ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients underwent a ser@@ o@@ conversion within 3 months from the start of the treatment , with a more severe follow @-@ up form in the patients under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature exp@@ ir@@ ation of the study ) , no investig@@ ational antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say were found in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients who had never come to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ sion .
patients with a lack of low @-@ low antibody levels showed a robust lowering of the G@@ AG level in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tres a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ al@@ ising inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not appear to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the justification for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient re@@ establishment of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient indicated the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 minute case .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week for a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms showed an improvement in lung function and ability to perform in the following table .
in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ radio@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
as regards the hetero@@ geneous manifestation of the disease between the patients , which was considered clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean form of form showed a normal mental development rate whereas in the older patients with severe form of circulation only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms met@@ ering schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute ear test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can be a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , evaluate each year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a single dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed below 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medication against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or spread probably easily to other parts of the body ) . • Progressive or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to decrease side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( remedy against vomiting ) and fluids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood count changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose will be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from split@@ ting .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form occurs more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
for patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells , the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparable medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each punch bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the punch bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see paragraph 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except in case of over@@ drive epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - and locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma , except for pre@@ valent plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is required to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions a day before and during the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute common toxic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity occurs Grade 3 or 4 or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with age 65 years or over 65 years of age , an increased side effect risk exists .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to inadequate data for safety and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which could go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a h@@ ep@@ atic functional restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or tran@@ spon@@ in values of &gt; to 3.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to knock @-@ and @-@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality number has reg@@ ained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ again .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ va cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with mixed @-@ mixed methods ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergometer is considered before the treatment of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated lifel@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced risk of mixed leak@@ age with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - should be avoided 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment beginning to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether mixed breast milk passes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed infants cannot be ruled out .

the clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the 3 P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mono therapy studies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .

clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial Pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their treatment ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting sandwich @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking thy@@ me dro@@ ph@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , di@@ hydro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , and gly@@ cine am@@ i@@ dri@@ calcium @-@ m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ves patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma demonstrated that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage compared to those patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC resulted in medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months for patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar for par@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medium PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1,8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients required the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion areas over a period of 10 minutes .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and are unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats achieved with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss was observed for patients .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ eling , chair @-@ pull , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , passage of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fur ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used for patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must not be applied in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption ( insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant women and nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited Company a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ isch , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the drug or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • chronic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich one @-@ meal or low @-@ fat diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed in both a study on the interaction of drugs and in several cases concur@@ rent use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , it should be recommended to take a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug because absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the frequency of adverse events detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ defined size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 m@@ g. of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on tests on humans and animals it is possible that any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at are caused by a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
from clinical trials it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ isch , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight versus the starting point ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in the study , who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies weight loss was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin came with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2,4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol in or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline of 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 . in general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , were identified in a study involving obes@@ e patients who were approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified without any particular danger to humans .
pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , described in the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the approval application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood you will exceed your fat limit decreases . • Dis@@ count your recommended amount of fat evenly to your daily meals .
save the amount of calories you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial night@@ fall , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Do not store medicine for children . • Do not use any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the car@@ ton . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed tanks with Sili@@ ca@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow it . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is included in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
sustained weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should intake a maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories suitable for you can be found in the information below which indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the effect of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms .
34 . this reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily on a daily basis or do other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily by exercise , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minute gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
• To achieve lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and to adhere to it . • Sens@@ ory is a nutritional diary containing information about the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you eat cal@@ ory and fat scent and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type of weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
alo@@ es is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ ma@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the agent inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
alo@@ e was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regi@@ mens , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of the patients treated with al@@ ma@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of the patients treated with al@@ ma@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd Company to appro@@ ve the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in the case of severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moder@@ ately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on announcement , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al obstruc@@ tions or signs of an acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required while simultaneously offering pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous addition of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences of the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with al@@ ma@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
the group with the highest dose showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; no dose @-@ effects were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an alo@@ of over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time : 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After the intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations results in a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the whole dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to 3 consecutive days the total composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time delivery of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on metaboli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , are involved in the I@@ so enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an IV single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection in healthy subjects , the total length of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the termin@@ ale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence showed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block ion channels only in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) which were given daily over two years led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is used for the unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the nar@@ ration of approval for the placing of the drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage occurs , moreover , the values of liver enzyme al@@ anine amino acids ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon revealed data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared to 4@@ 55 patients in the study of hepatitis C patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were vo@@ iced to ensure that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease again fl@@ amed up in more patients than with the refer@@ ee drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition to this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mation ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lins resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ man@@ go against this type of infection may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface to be treated should not amount to more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were considered together on skin dogs , about 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or from infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation on the order .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little in@@ fir@@ mation , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary infected wounds the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was inadequate .
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or degradation of the infected spot after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached in people after topical use on poor skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ X increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on a sk@@ unk skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued or termin@@ ated with Al@@ tar@@ go is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect irritation at the destination which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from c@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s lower unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide @-@ transfer , blocking partly P @-@ binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infections seem question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and sc@@ rap@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples took place in the days 3 or 4 in adults , each before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake on humans according to topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ sm of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro test on genetic mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rats micro@@ seed test for in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility for oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical appli@@ que on 200 c@@ m2 ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( see above ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ fold vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and is ensured that the two doses existing vacc@@ ination plan can be carried out .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by &quot; contributing &quot; to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can fight against an illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ ination approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within three doses of an existing vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 doses of vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals so a permit for placing Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardis@@ ation plan for the basic immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ination , whereby the first dose is administered at the time of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her is requested for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons , who have responded to a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a re@@ fres@@ her process as protection because they may also be protected from immune memory in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is needed , the combination vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the pri@@ mor@@ dial treatment , so that in these cases the gift of additional doses may be required .
since intra@@ arter@@ ial injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal immun@@ isation in the glut@@ eal muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in the case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this wor@@ ding in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ cial and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing ino@@ cul@@ ation formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 up to and including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and accuracy on a calculation basis per dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the addition of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects according to a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of toxic@@ ity per pro@@ band was comparable to 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was observed when administ@@ ering the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines reported by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was exp@@ ectable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ins ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 following the addition of the 3 @-@ c@@ anned vaccine .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study for 1 @-@ 11 year olds one month following the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of the basic immun@@ isation could demonstrate the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies for at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the discovery of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ - and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for previous formulation for the current formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as poll@@ uted waters contaminated by water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that might make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect against infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the vacc@@ ination date ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ chy skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier ino@@ cul@@ ation against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B .
• If you want to quickly have a hepatitis B protection ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / she will recommend three inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child is subject to a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take any further medicines ( including those you may have received without prescription ) or if you have received / have received / or your child have received / has received / or this is planned in the near future .
it may however be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person therefore is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , separate areas and limbs should be ino@@ cul@@ ated at the same time .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant women or breast @-@ feeding women are not given , unless it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Just tell your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
if you miss the appointment scheduled for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 b@@ ump@@ y doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the stit@@ ch or redness • Mat@@ ch@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 spra@@ yed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Erg@@ onom@@ ic • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 atom@@ ized doses ) are reported :
these include loc@@ alized or prolonged rash , which may itch or be pu@@ ffy , swelling of the eyes and the face , app@@ alling breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ perception like ting@@ ling and &quot; ant @-@ run , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions
fain@@ ting infections of some blood vessels mal@@ aise or illness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea , and abdominal pain , liver function tests lymp@@ h no@@ des , increased tendency to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ising ) caused by drop in the amount of blood cells .
23 inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you may notice any side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data known since the initial approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP insisted that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( cereb@@ ral damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a gastro@@ enter@@ tainer ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) is given .
this was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without drug ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or flavor release , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia values .
ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug was available .
the use is indicated in all patients showing a complete lack of enzyme already in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that is manifested after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ active en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein toler@@ ances and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine cu@@ cc@@ in@@ atal syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk of the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablet contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which is the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal cancer who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
one case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ated glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturbances in the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate taken for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nit@@ ro@@ genous ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who had already been treated before the first onset of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even in these patients it was time for many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ spon@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , recovered from a hyper@@ trop@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , was 98 % survival rate .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are unlikely to be reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mono@@ amine origin@@ ates .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were calculated according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single items as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients after an intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking .
in the majority of patients suffering from ure@@ asy or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the plasma next morning after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no lam@@ ell@@ ous effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who are not able to swallow the tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or through a gastro@@ enter@@ ologist or nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which is the maximum daily dose .
if rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ ds cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal cancer who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances in the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate taken for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine nitrogen .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients submitting a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ogenic was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ annab@@ ino@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or one year in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in reference to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other hi@@ ud@@ ine , or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in in the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the placing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ elevation inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous drop of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure a release of 0,5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the en@@ cro@@ achment .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ om@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a directly followed intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ angi@@ ogenic dose of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI surgery is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before use and administered intraven@@ ously quickly .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dosage should be checked again .
in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the use of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Bol@@ us without c@@ logging in an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with Angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after completion of intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated hay or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular lifting .
• well known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against ud@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially if bi@@ val@@ ira is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
even if most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges can occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) while the treatment generally occurs everywhere .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ira , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ira is again achieved before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate inhibit@@ or ) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with plat@@ el@@ ets of plat@@ el@@ ets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be checked regularly .
the animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , we@@ aning or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ira group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding , as defined in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ Cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point range , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point spots , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients who are PCI .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ira group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ classes .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to the signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ocular inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ion bone region of thro@@ mb@@ ine , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly split the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ira was unable to indu@@ ce a plat@@ el@@ et @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the patients below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ wife inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed across the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years of age with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) , A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm , or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot process efficiently .
insulin lu@@ b@@ sin differs very slightly from the insulin , and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study conducted with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot perform insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin lu@@ b@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal cavity area .
due to reduced glucose tolerance and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change of the force , the brand ( label ) , the type of insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can trigger a change in the insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
mig@@ rating a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the influence of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ fusion lu@@ b@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin loss occurs in human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insulin does not come into breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral treatment .
listed below are listed the unwanted drug cur@@ es known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
cold - wel@@ ness , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ bling , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Op@@ ens to continuously change the injection site within the injection range , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or treated by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be from insulin lu@@ b@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with a hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ - tus , insulin in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosage range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , just like the human insulin .
insulin lu@@ b@@ sin has twice as fast as normal insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than a human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that a comparable post @-@ den@@ ounced gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ b@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
a better post @-@ den@@ ounced control than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control will be achieved like with a human normal insulin which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ds prior to the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin L@@ ess with Gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin injection at a time of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
