<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPAR), in which the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package supplement (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirren thought and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental disorder where patients alternate manic episodes (periods of anorexic high-mood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution can be used to take in or the melt tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time taking Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole supposedly works primarily as a" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin have a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Ariadprazole contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder leading to increased unrest, compared with the Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the patient's symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution for intake (recording).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials of the injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-term studies decreased manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased unrest even more effectively than placebo and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled strain), trembling, somnolence (distipation), vomiting, nausea, obstipation (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ariadprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for placing Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were referred to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Given the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is decomposed of combination therapy, the Ariadprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treating with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk associated with Ariadprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overconductive disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispense for hypotonia (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoceliac and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Ariadprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Ariadprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Ariadprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events involving patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in relation to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Ariadprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally-acting drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% whereas the CMAX remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' metabolizers may result in joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibozol compared to CYP2D6 extensioners.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Ariadprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethysts / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omezzol) and 3A4 (dextromethysts).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and the concerns raised in the reproduction studies of the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Ariadprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were reported more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study lasting more than 52 weeks, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathalie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Ariadprazl's treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripibol was 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients treated with Aria prazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another 12-week study, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripivole treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was for patients treated with Aria prazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphate kinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence as reported in the treatment with Ariadprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute dosages with Ariadprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in treating an overdose with Aripibozol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose is beneficial as Aripiprazole has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Ariadprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergies and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and on the putt.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Ariadprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who retained a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Ariadprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg - depression-rate scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Ariadprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the relapse rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olancone-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was "weight gain", an increase of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5%).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, Ariadprazole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, Ariadprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Ariadprazole showed a versus placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly did not refer to lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripibozol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Ariadprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Ariadprazole showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in the prevention of a relapse to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxylization of Aripibozol, the N-dealkyylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor 'poor' metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A post-specific pharmacokinetic analysis showed no clinically significant differences in regard to ethnicity or effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mid-steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, the concentrations of the sulfate conjugates of hydroxy- aripibozole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mid-steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ariadprazole, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melt tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, the patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripivole injections are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescriptions or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overconductive disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispense for hypotonia (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoceliac and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and indications of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in relation to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">However, the intensity of sedsedation was greater compared with the one-time addition of Aripiprazole in a study where healthy volunteers received Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) as a single dosage intramuscular and who simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers can result in a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that of the sole dose of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripivole injection solution compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aria prazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another 12-week study, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients treated with Aria prazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term recovery phase of over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was for patients treated with Ariadprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence as reported in the treatment with Ariadprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant significant improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score with the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Ariadprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who retained a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Ariadprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression-scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher decline in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olancone-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was "weight gain", an increase of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5%).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly did not refer to lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripibozol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Ariadprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Ariadprazole showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in the prevention of a relapse to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole AUC is 90% greater the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ following repeated dose during systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 - and 5-times over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after an intravenous application, no safety-related concerns arose after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">Effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the moderate-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who are still in the blood or have low blood pressure before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Human Use Committee (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other paclitaxel medications, it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">January 2008 the European Commission granted the Company Abraxis BioScience Limited approval for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrox number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy in the treatment of Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3, treatment is to be interrupted until the improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of canned adaptation in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired renal function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data to recommend dosage adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to inadequate data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have significantly different pharmacological features than other types of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">No renewed treatment cycles should be initiated in the patients until the number of patients has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While the cardiotoxicity which is clearly related to Abraxane has not been proven, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case patients receive nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea after the treatment of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic agents and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable seal method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treating via a blocking account, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very frequent) and dizziness (often) which can impact immunity and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy have occurred in every dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactoase hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stool, esophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, abdominal pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal correlation with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a timid microtubules that promotes the maturation of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transfcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and, as part of in-vitro studies, it has been proven that the presence of albumin supports the transport of paclitaxel with endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendocthelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumination receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area due to the albumble protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single-arm unlinked studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a 3-week monotherapy with paclitaxel, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour fusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% for metastatic disease and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposition of active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2. the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascularity distribution and / or width binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with an intravenous 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane using the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-based paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">After the Abraxane injection, the clearing of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver micro and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for the unaltered amount of active ingredient was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic agent and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be taken care of when handling Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, the sodium chloride infusion solution is injected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute to a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the punch bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then rinse the punch bottle slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or be inverted until full full suspension of the powder is done.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications could occur in connection with blood transfusion, if self-bleeding is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to have a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be done by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always lie in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is inserted which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was used as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused anemia, compared to the referee drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected with Eprex / Erypo for at least 8 weeks before they were either switched to Abseamed or continued receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of streamed skin streamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, hemoglobin values were maintained by patients who were switched to Abseamed to the same extent as those patients who continue receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common adverse effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Unseamed should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed the European Union has provided evidence that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex, and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed over or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin invariability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest licensed dose required to control anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher retention doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher retention doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reactions of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared with the starting point, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the rise in haemoglobin increases &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of the number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l ≥ 0.62 mmol / l) is increased three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of antibodies by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl relative to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), where the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, Abyamed should receive a total dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the onset of autologous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">On this occasion, epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each on 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="409">For patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in a autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, secondary arterial disease, vascular disease of the karotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomblockade (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after monex up to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with an increased need for transfusions, the threshold cyte value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the ythrocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reaction locyte "index"), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0,5%), the platelets and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow can be considered for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epoetine when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the anemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidentified coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is still not dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-offering and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on benefits-risk assessment involving the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">If possible, before the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treating epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative thrombosis / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was aspired</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no indication of interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral thrombosis, cerebral infarction), ischemic thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysm, reinalthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening of existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombodivascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the erythropoietin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically derived epoetin alfa is glycosides and, in terms of amino acids and carbohydrate percentage, is identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of native patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoiesis and does not influence leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patient.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin showed an unexplained, statistically significant higher mortality compared to controls in the patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and with controls.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hemoglobin value less than 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data.</seg>

<seg id="526">Prior to market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of member states, the holder of approval for placing the medicine in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies will provide the following information and materials: • Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging.</seg>
<seg id="527">The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmacovigilance system described in version 3.0 is set up and functioning in module 1.8.1. before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine used in the transport is applied.</seg>
<seg id="528">The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market commits itself to the trials listed in the pharmacovigilance plan and additional measures for pharmacovigilance as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) listed in the module 1.8.2. and, according to each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan, adopted by the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="529">According to the "CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use," an updated RMP should be provided simultaneously with the next updated report on the harmlessness of the drug (Periodic Safety Update Report, PSUR).</seg>
<seg id="530">In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: • receiving new information which may affect the current safety specification, the pharmacovigilance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone (the pharmacovigilance or risk reduction)</seg>
<seg id="531">• Have suffered a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable angina pectoris (for the first time occurring or increased chest pain) • the risk of blood clatropy in veins (deep vein thrombosis) exists - if, for example, such a drop of blood has occurred before you.</seg>
<seg id="532">You suffer from severe circulatory disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease), the arteries of the legs or arms (peripheral arterial occlusion), the neck vessels (vascular disease of the carotid) or the brain (cerebrovascular disease) recently suffered a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="533">During the treatment with unseamed it can lead to a slight dose-dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="534">Your doctor may conduct regular blood tests if necessary to control the number of platelets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="535">Lack of iron, the dissolution of the red blood cells (haemolysis), blood loss, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Abseamed before the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="536">Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an antigenic erythroblastomia after monate- until years of treatment with subcutaneous (under the skin moulded) erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="537">If you are suffering from erythroblastomia, it will abort your treatment with Abseamed and determine how your anaemia is best handled.</seg>
<seg id="538">Therefore, Abyamed must be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) if you are treated for anemia due to kidney disease.</seg>
<seg id="539">A high haemoglobin is the risk for problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased.</seg>
<seg id="540">In case of elevated or increasing levels of potassium, your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="541">If you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clinically exposed coronary artery disease or shrinkage due to insufficient heart rate, your doctor will make sure that your hemoglobin mirror does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="542">According to the present findings, the treatment of anemia with Abseamed in adults with chronic kidney failure (renal insufficiency), which has not yet been dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="543">A 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin-alfa-offering and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dye (haemoglobin) and adjust your Abseamed dose to keep the risk of thrombosis (thrombotic event) as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk for thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese or if in the past thrombotic vascular events occurred (e.g. a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">In case you are cancer patient, keep in mind that Abseamed works like a growth factor for blood cells and may adversely affect the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="547">If you have a larger orthopaedic surgery, the cause of your anaemia should be examined before the start of treatment and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) are too high, you should not get rid of Abseamed because there is an increased risk of blood clots after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="549">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines / apply / used until recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="550">If you are taking Ciclosporin (means to suppress the immune system) during your treatment with Abseamed, your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="551">Laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF (G-CSF and GM-CSF).</seg>
<seg id="552">Depending on how your anaemia refers to treatment, the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor may prescribe regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure the drug works properly and your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well set, you will receive regular doses of streamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice a week, spread over two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor may prescribe regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how anaemia refers to treatment, the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To ensure this and make sure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor holds this for appropriate, you can also learn how to spatter Abyamed himself underneath the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attacks, cerebral haemorrhages, stroke, transient circulatory disorders of the brain, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, vascular diseases (aneurysms), thrombosis of the retina and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="561">Eye lids and lips (swelling-edema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, hot feeling and faster pulse were reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblastomblockade means that no longer sufficient red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see the section called "Specific caution when applying Abseamed").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations it can - irrespective of the treatment with abseamed - come to a blood culturing (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">Treatment with Abseamed can be associated with an increased risk of blood clumping after surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) if your initial hemoglobin value is too high</seg>
<seg id="565">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or if you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="566">When a syringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and room temperature has reached (up to 25 ° C), it must be used either within 3 days or be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fracture (fractures), including those who have recently suffered a little traumatic hernia as during the fall; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">As the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material was used for Zometa to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8,000 elderly women with osteoporosis were involved, and the number of spinal and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies to a total of 357 patients and compared to a different bisphosphonate for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in the serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75% compared with the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women the risk of spinal fractures in patients with Aclasta (excluding other osteoporosis drugs) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to those in Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis medication) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 out of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Do not use Aclasta in patients who may be hypersensitive to celoleironic acid or other bisphosphonate or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reaction to the infusion and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta producer provides information for physicians to prescribe the Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications of how the medicine is to be applied, and a similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with recently suffered low-traumatic fractures.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract contraindication in pregnancy and breast-feeding women • Requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing help</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic fracture, Aclasta's infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, correspondingly twice daily at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic acetate, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see Section 4.4) For Patients with a Creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents suffering from Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">A temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop because of the rapid implementation of the effect of citric acid on bone reconstruction, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, correspondingly twice daily at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (bad oral hygiene) should undergo a dental examination with appropriate pre-ventilated dental treatment prior to an application of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients needing dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of severe side effects reported by atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney Dysfunction Zoledronutride was associated with kidney dysfunction, which was associated as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were in a clinical study for osteoporosis more than three years comparable between the placebo and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatins within 10 days of the treatment was observed in 1.8% of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies compared to 21%.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently reported hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been occasionally treated, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which have been treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoomyelitis, and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area with an Aclasta and a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose leading to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering orally calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a BMD-T-score ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebrate fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebrate fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk for spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk for hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density in lumbar vertebra, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire thigh by 6.0%, the thigh neck by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the retention of the trabecular bone architecture in the case of Aclasta compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55% below baseline value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortalities were 10% (101 patients) in the placebo-treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment in comparison with placebo treatment increased BMD at the total air and thigh neck at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo treatment, the Aclasta therapy led to an increase of BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% at the end of the chain.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), once weekly, Aclasta did not submit an annual dose of alendronate relative to the percentage change in the lumbar BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was evaluated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, particularly mild to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg. of Zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate, in a mean period of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of citric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be doscially independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly reduced to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance of the large circulatory cycle with half-life time t ½ A 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long exclusion period with a terminal eliminary cycle time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption into the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is primarily tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">Decreased Clearance by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely to be metabolized because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the cyedronic acid correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function down to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) contains only limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-mineral-acting intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC were 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous use, the renal tolerance of zoledronic acid in rats was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose, which is equivalent to 6-times the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC, corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">Long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, performed toxicological effects in other organs including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiabsorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and skeletal abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits despite the maternal toxicity at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum-calcium level.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before the application; normally, 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="671">Bisphosphonate is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the Morbus Paget, the bone reconstruction happens too fast, and new bone material is set up unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone reconstruction, ensuring a normal bone formation and thus reinforces strength to the bones.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you are using Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / apply / have recently taken / applied even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drink, you should be concerned that you have sufficient fluid before and after the treatment with Aclasta according to your doctor's instructions.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year, which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="680">If you have recently broken the hip, it is recommended to administer Aclasta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">As Aclasta works for a long time, you may need another dose after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If you missed the administration of Aclasta, contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before completing the therapy with Aclasta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next medical appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion often occur (with more than 30% of patients), but are less common after subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days of the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), in which the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients), where metformin (a diabetetic medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylurea and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acetate treatment, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonylurea and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes more variable.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetin was examined in triple therapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, additionally they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos reduced HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy trial, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea was 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study evaluating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who took actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain, and anesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive to pioglitazon or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin for patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for placing Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marker" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and edema when pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision on whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should continue until the laboratory parameters have been submitted to the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrite (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocytes by 1-2% and hematocytes by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients receiving pioglitazon as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or dual combination therapy with insulin, the risk of high doses-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, treatment with thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, worsening of diabetic macular edema, was reported with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">Fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on drug interactions have shown that pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC by pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazon, the elevated insulin resistance of the mother animal in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not available from present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and refractive index of the lens, as seen in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazon ALT ascents over three times the upper limit of the normal range often occurred as often as under placebo but more rarely than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more frequently when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients in the group treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to be activated by activation of specific nuclei receptors (PPAR-γ) activated in the animal model for increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had not been sufficiently adjusted despite a three-month improvement phase with insulin were randomized to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c value decreased by 0.45% compared to those who continue to receive insulin, a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / creatinin quotient in comparison to baseline data was observed.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small 18 week study on Type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazon while under Metformin and Gliclazid diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the intimidation of triglycerides, but also improved postdenal increased triglyceride levels, both with an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups which received either pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is resorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV equates to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with fibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and at a lower extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and apes concurred with repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with pioglitazon, the hyperinsulinemia associated with the gestation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindians led to increased frequency of colonizing tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">Fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with either Pioglitazon or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / creatinin quotient in comparison to baseline data was observed.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the intimidation of triglycerides, but also improved postdenal increased triglyceride levels, both with effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study failed to determine its primary endpoint, which showed a combination of the overall morale, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation on the ankle, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with the intake of pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks showing how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrophane has led to a decrease in HbA1c mirror suggesting that the blood sugar levels have been lowered as much as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Acetone should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to (allergic) to the human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of acetate may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the packaging element).</seg>
<seg id="869">The CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of acetacane in the treatment of diabetes were outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk a / S a permit for placing Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can perceive the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA against insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to acetate in the patient, it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which are going through several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always after other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Serious hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures, and may end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Occasionally - Peripheral Neuropathy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neuropathy and are normally reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. an intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in the blood sugar level can be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Disorders of skin and underskin tissue Actually - Lipoystrophy On the injection site can cause a lipodystrophy if failed to change the puncture points inside the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the administration point of the administration - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma can occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasional - urticaria, exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized oversensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can however gradually develop: • Easy hypoglycaemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>

<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the addition of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) did not lead to any clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (mean increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats have shown that alendronate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then rapidly redistributed into the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fences.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml / min and systemic Clearance was not 200 ml / min.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the graft was rejected after a treatment period of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or re-recording of dialysis was needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how Advantal is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative wording, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advantal should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level measurements (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advantf, the Tacrolimus-Talents should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both in both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tacrolimus-level mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advancement, to ensure adequate substance exposure during the immediate post-surgical period.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As Tacrolimus is a low-Clearance substance, an adjustment of the Advance dose can take several days before the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments can be necessary later as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change in the course of the stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Can recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advantf must be converted a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advantal, so this conversion has to take place at a rate of 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant Following a switch from other immunosuppressants to Advantl once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplant must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients, which are transferred to Advantal, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other graft receiver Although there is no clinical experience with lung, pancreatic and colorectal patients, Prograf was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for colorectal cancer patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced hepatic function To maintain blood signals in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum levels of serum, a calculation of creatine data and a monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advantf When migrating from a Ciclosporine to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of thoroughbred tacrolimus-level monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent check of the tacrolimus-level mirror during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-sebaceous levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled following conversion from prograf to advagraf, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent use of substances that could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advancement is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may need several days before the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the sebaceous levels in the blood exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the upper levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur in the result of Tacrolimus's under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has proven to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation is available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and graft recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the retardized wording Advancement.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effects of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with advagraph can be avoided (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required because the tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septic hypertrophy labeled as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advancement.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of maligner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advantages contain hard capsules, retardized, lactose, there are special caution in patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines, known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus increase or lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetical studies revealed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus resulting from the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 may interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus reduces the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increases hormone exposure, decisions on contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus could potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of examinations in transplant patients have no indication that, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In the case of utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended to possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and hyperkalemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-virus-associated nephropathy and JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advancement.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours have been reported in combination with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, Tacrolimus cannot be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Effective mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by its binding to a cytosolite protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a specific line of lymphocytokines.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 patients transplanted patients, in 475 patients undergoing a pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant were used as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to the major studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter trial with oral prograf was reported over 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">A chronic graft rejection, the obliterate bronchiolitis syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Trege et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, 21,7% of the cases for the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans were compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients treated by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus group (Trege et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome in patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-centric study with oral prograf was conducted to 205 patients who were also undergoing a pancreas and kidney transplant, which were randomised to receive tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target range from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressive after colorectal transplants showed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional donation of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolim, which lead to tallow between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematocrit value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids shall be responsible for the higher clearance installments observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion occurs mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advancement was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent check of the tacrolimus-level mirror during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood coagulation disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether lawyers are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is inserted which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Lawyer is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made in a different way so that the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate topical haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under 6 years of age, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advant in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepciodes with "excellent" and "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advance (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or witch protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a approval for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma concentrations (in% of the norm or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injections every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, a proper determination of factor VIII-plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached, or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage speed should be adjusted according to the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 reposition days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 reposition days and anamnestically known inhibitory development, a recombinant VIII product was observed to prevent recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">ADR's largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all previously untreated patients with a higher risk of inhibitors formation, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-mirror occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th post-operative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitortiter (2,4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 reposition days with ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, no 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days) found a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE were treated inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titres for these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell proteins, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions as part of the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, on the basis of ADVATE's security profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided to apply for further extension procedures for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited (CHMP) officially announced that the company resumes its application for approval for the placing of Advance in the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that links other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified so that it does not produce any copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors, allowing cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defect in the human body is normally used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni's cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni's cancer occurred in the area of the fracture, the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company on the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that the injections of Advance in Li-Fraumeni tumours will benefit patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advance can be made in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor to people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified ingredient release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, an allergy to pollen caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clapped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose the patients who received averages were reported to decrease the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who alone took pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients with Aerinaze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received the loss of Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart disease), oral drying, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive to disloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients that are anti-adrenergic agents or loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (aggravated urination), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrosis) or a hemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for placing averages in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have died.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days, as long-term use of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, liurid, cableolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which are peroral or nasal as abscant rhinologics (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxyacetazoline, Naphhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not tested for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treating hypertension or a tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or increasing headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Attention: • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder semi-obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistaminika otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce it to its extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials involving disloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor study showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the loratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether the loratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not stop in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies revealed however no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of Pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizzlement which may result in impairment or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS Stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravating miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precursive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study involving adults, the 5 mg disloratadin showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including amplification of subjective somnolence or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamic antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine during the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to patient subgroups defined by gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study of the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole application of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was the exposure to the gift of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated administration, toxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, preclinical data with disloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-toxicological studies the combination of laureadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the approval application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, and its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases appear or be diagnosed with you when using Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • heart disease, palpitations • Cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headache, or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Tightness and operation of machines When used at the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to lightheadedness or decreases the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinae than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten the intake of Aerinaze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart attack, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, throat pain, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness and dizziness.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives rash and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle aches, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspicuous liver enzymes were also reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg tablet tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup, and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies involving about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by identifying the changes in the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and capacity of the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for the intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius led to an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to loratadin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of loratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may end after the decay of the symptoms and can be resumed during its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">If the rhinitis persists (appearance of symptoms 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), a continuous treatment can be recommended for patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with disloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically pharmacological study, alcohol intake was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to lightheadedness which may result in impairment of mutilation or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with disloratadin and 6.9% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study involving up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which disloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dosage) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of fluid performance including amplification of subjective somnolence or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week, and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As was shown on the basis of the overall score of the questionnaire about quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces stress caused by seasonal allergenic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a representative for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is similar regardless of the etiology of the different forms and chronic patients can be prospectively recalculated.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine exposure is a causal factor in all urarial diseases, it is expected that disloratadin, except in the chronically idiopathic urticaria, leads to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the cheating rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with disloratadin compared to 19% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant stimulation after once daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study involving desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with loratadin and loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of loratadin and loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with disloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose-monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmine (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data exists which support treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomic anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations, and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize lost loratadin and experience higher substances (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which have a limited metabolism, is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomaltase- insufficiency should not use this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinically pharmacological study, alcohol intake was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years, who were eligible for an anti-histamic therapy, received a daily braloratadindosage of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years old) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of disloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents who were used in the desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinically-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dosage) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets did not affect psychomotor impairment in adults and adolescents in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, alcohol induced alcohol induced loss of alcohol was neither increased nor increased drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restrictive metabolic phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger at black (18% adults, 16% children) than Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis that can be impaired.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminale half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of a clinically relevant active substance-cumulation after once daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the study showed that the AUC and CMAx values of desloratadin in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announced the approval of the CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the use of Aflunov for the prevention of avialous H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is supposed to protect from a strain of influenza virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A pandemic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus occurs, which can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the part of the flu virus as" "" "foreign" "" "contained in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is then able to form more quickly antibodies at a contact with a flu virus of this common trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus was separated, cleaned and used as part of the vaccine with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as foreign bodies).</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you require further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for taking the capsules, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which antiviral drug the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between the ages of four and twelve, and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and hence the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which was strengthened with low dosed kritonavir, was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with unproven levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were only very few responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the trial with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase strengthened the viral load after 16-week treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, came to a stronger viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase must also not be used in patients who take St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are broken down as well as Agenerase and are health-damaging in high blood concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovery of the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat protease inhibitors outweigh the risk of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the rejects found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not take protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because for scientific reasons only limited information was published." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited Company a permit for placing asgenerations within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerative capsules and solution are not interchangeable for intake on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerative capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (Boosters), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerations in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data for safety and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders at 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic latitude and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450 isoencycms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, asgeneric capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of a simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is heavily dependent on CYP3A4, an concurrent administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, asterase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentrations of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored to obstinate symptoms, especially if also low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycogen content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, or an exacerbation of an existing type of diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug addicts, such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilia patients (type A and B) who were treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorrhages occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial ethology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were especially reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 isocycms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic latitude Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be used together with medicines whose agents are primarily metabolized above CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC from amprenavir resulting in virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma concentrations by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already uses St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, to check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavira below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, however, for CMAX reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials dosages of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% abducts when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The plasmin values of amprenavir in plasma treated with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended for close-meshed monitoring as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was performed to use Agenerase in combination with Didanosin, but because of the antazied component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and asgenerations are at least an hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may lower serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, because Delavirus may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is advised if these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Simultaneous injection of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dosage, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2,69x compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if used together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with asterase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase because it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir may lead to a degradation of amprenavir plasma concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelipine, Nicardius, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by 10 amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use of Agenerase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time as Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of this HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these medicines with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with concurrent administration of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenerations may not be used together with orally taken midazolam (see Section 4.3), while at the same time it is advisable to be careful with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicates a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored to obstinate symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is no recommendation that the amprenavirus dose can be adjusted if Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase a reinforced control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been proven in the milk of lactose-related substances, but it is not known whether Amprenavir is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the noodine to the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight during breast-feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">The side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early on and rarely resulted in a break in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether or not they are in connection with the use of Agenerase or any other medicines applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of asterase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study meditations and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) occurring in the treatment are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and minor subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocereal fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">113 antiretroviral patients treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks were observed only one case (bullpen) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study ProAB 3006 patients were treated with amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%), in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderately pronounced, erythematinous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be terminated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral treatment (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI-treated patients receiving 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low-dosed kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who received Agenerase together with low dosed ritonavir, very often.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is indicated on signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral genetic and gag-pol- polyproteinprecursors with the result of an unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory concentration of amprenavir is 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and inhibiting HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir alloyed treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the described mutations are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not treated with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I50V, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its prolongation APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analyses of genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to fossiamprenavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinical validated phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypical cut-offs (dividers) for FPV / RTV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain cross resistance against ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossiamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients with which a Fosamprenavirus-containing scheme failed (one of them showed resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at treatment beginning and another against tirelavir), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early discontinuation of a treatment is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI treated pretreated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the virus load (HIV-1-RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-inflow threshold of 0.4 lo10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was dosed twice daily, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs that were administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data the expected benefits of" "" "unbiased" "" "asterase should be taken into account when optimizing therapy with PI-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAX when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was impacted by food intake, although simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430-l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to the tissue by a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change results in a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the stealth state across the area of CMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 respectively, respectively, inhibit or a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with asgenerations (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the impact of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those that are obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas in male animals occurred in doses that were 2.0 times (mice) or 3.8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinoma has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic use, showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic in a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutational tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, micronucleus test on rats and chromosomal aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies for juveniles treated with 4 days of age showed high mortality in both the control and amprenavir animals.</seg>

<seg id="2217">According to the study plan, evaluating the clinical signs showed that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine cream were very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too severe shot formation and sales (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg of imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic concentrations of the alpha interference and other cytokines were detected after topical use of imiquimine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete eradication of the warts in an imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients who had been treated with imiquimodine patients completely healed the warts; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in five-colour application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed single primary superfical basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimodine three times a week in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic lesions within a conjunctive 25 cm2 large treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications external genital warts, actinic keratosis and superfical basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimodine could not be demonstrated in these studies at the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three-week application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml on the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine after topical application on MC-infected skin was low from 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or supernatural basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on the dermal application carried out four months also yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumours to the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk to the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the anti-oxidant cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if these have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● cowwarts (condylomata acuminata), formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● surface basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it may lead to abnormalities, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratosis are rough areas of the skin that occur in people exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used in flat-actinic keratosis in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratosis, or the virus responsible for infection with cowwarts.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have used Aldara cream or other similar preparations previously, please inform your doctor about this before starting with the treatment. if you have problems with your immune system, consult Aldara Cream only if the area to be treated is cured after a previous medication or surgical treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2250">Once the reactions are gone, you can continue the treatment. inform your doctor if they don't have a normal blood count</seg>
<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, thinning of the skin or difficulty in withdrawing the foreskin can be expected with increased incidence of pre-conjunctival swelling.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not use Aldara cream in the urethra, vagina (vagina), the cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines will have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sex during the infection with genital warts in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) must be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently used it, even if it is a non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeeding your baby during treatment with Aldara cream is not known, as it is not known whether imiquimodine is transferred into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different at tilts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream on the clean dry skin area with the warts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully covered.</seg>
<seg id="2259">"" "men with genital warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area below (see section 2" "" "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara cream?" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks, 5 days a week leave a sufficient amount of Aldara cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>
<seg id="2262">Very common side-effects (expected in more than 1 out of 10 patients) Frequent side effects (expected in less than 1 out of 100 patients) Occurring side effects (with less than 1 of 1000 patients expected) Very rare side effects (in less than 1 of 10,000 patients expected)</seg>
<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist about it immediately if you do not feel well during the use of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further, wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue stain to occur in you sooner or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which end up in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, dermatitis, bladder, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, heat feeling or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, nasal swelling, swelling of the eyelids, redness, swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzymatic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of aldurazyms should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was measured (by examining its effect in reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in extremities (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients less than five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated rate of heart), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may be disclosed each year and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyms with regard to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to approve the placing of Aldurazyms in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyma should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h, if the patient is able to tolerate this, can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which resettlement facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase III trial, nearly all patients have IgG antibodies to form Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">There is little experience with regard to resuming treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment, caution must be taken.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistaminika and / or antipyretika) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single severe infusion-conditional reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to a decline, a treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyms should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with intracellular intracellular intakes of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, which include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As there is no data on newborns exposed to breast milk over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with aldurazyms observed during the Phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following abundances: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-induced involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, shortness of breath and face edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with a predominantly severe follow-up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients underwent a seroconversion within 3 months from the start of the treatment, with a more severe follow-up form in the patients under the age of 5 (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature expiration of the study), no investigational antibodies (RIP) assay were found in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients who had never come to Serokonsion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low-low antibody levels showed a robust lowering of the GAG level in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAG was detected in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralising inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not appear to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The justification for enzymatic therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient reestablishment of enzymatic activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients were from the mean phenotype and only one patient indicated the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6 minute case.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of aldurazyms every week for a further 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurazyms showed an improvement in lung function and ability to perform in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepradioegaly prior to treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear drop in the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">As regards the heterogeneous manifestation of the disease between the patients, which was considered clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute hearing, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change in 10 patients (22%) and worsening in 9 patients (20%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean form of form showed a normal mental development rate whereas in the older patients with severe form of circulation only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyms metering schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute ear test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can be a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions, but it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available, evaluate each year, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in a single dose, toxicity in repeated application and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetrexed to its active form occurs more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>

<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, in which cancer did not attack the squamous cell cells, the administration of Alimta showed longer survival times than with the comparable medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to approve the placing of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each punch bottle must be dissolved with 4.2ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the punch bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml further (see paragraph 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small non-small cell carcinoma except in case of overdrive epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of second-line treatment of patients with loc- and locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, except for prevalent plate-epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completing the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">A corticosteroid is required to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions a day before and during the day of the Pemetrexed gift as well as on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete hemorrhage should be created before each administration, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute common toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dosages a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity occurs Grade 3 or 4 or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with age 65 years or over 65 years of age, an increased side effect risk exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to inadequate data for safety and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which could go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a hepatic functional restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold the upper bilirubin limit and / or transponin values of &gt; to 3.0-fold the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to knock-and-immunosuppression and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrality number has regained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ again.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrality, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 haematological and nichatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetremixed patients need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsaliva cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with mixed-mixed methods (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the ergometer is considered before the treatment of Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated lifelines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is through Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced risk of mixed leakage with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and minde- should be avoided 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed should be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is through Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment beginning to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether mixed breast milk passes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed infants cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients treated before, during or after their treatment (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic anti-folate which exercises its effect by interrupting sandwich-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works as an anti-folate with several points of attack by blocking thyme drophthase (DHFR), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycine amidricalcium-myltransferase (GARFT), which are the key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus cisplatin in chemonaives patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma demonstrated that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful advantage compared to those patients who were treated with cisplatin only.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) in connection with the malignant Pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the single Cisplaintin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open Phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC resulted in median survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on overall survival fell in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 399, 9.3 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2,26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data of a separately randomised, controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) are similar for paremetrexed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pretreatment with docetaxel.</seg>

<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low-calorie, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and are unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats achieved with food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss was observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side-effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on anus, flatus (winch) with stuhlabeling, chair-pull, greasy / oily chair, passage of oily secretion (fur), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used for patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must not be applied in patients who suffer from long-term malabsorption (insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant women and nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited Company a permit for placing orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalisch, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">As orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or renal function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the drug or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin • chronic malabsorption syndrome • Cholestase • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich one-meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed in both a study on the interaction of drugs and in several cases concurrent use of orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a supplement of the multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a small number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time observed a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug because absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events detected after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of undefined size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg. of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on tests on humans and animals it is possible that any systemic effects caused by orlistat are caused by a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect begins in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serin-rest of the gastrischen and pankreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical trials it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks absorption of approximately 25% of the food fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalisch, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight versus the starting point (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in the study, who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies weight loss was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin came with orlistat 60 mg -2,4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol in orlistat was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline of 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline of 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7. in general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl-leucine group), were identified in a study involving obese patients who were approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenous potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified without any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2571">If you omit a meal or a meal contains no fat, do not take a capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat, you risk diet-related accompanying symptoms (see section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to the new eating habits, start your first capsule intake with a calory and fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutrition stadiaries are effective, as you can easily understand what you eat, how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">In order to ensure your ultimate weight, you should set two daily goals in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Reducate fetal fat to decrease the likelihood of diet-related accompanying symptoms (see paragraph 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and thereby arise from the fact that more fat is excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts, as you may have not yet reduced the fat content in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimise nutritional side effects: • Start a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-fat diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood you will exceed your fat limit decreases. • Discount your recommended amount of fat evenly to your daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories you may consume per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main court or a substantial nightfall, as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloes is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of almaxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the agent inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloe was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients treated with almaxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients treated with almaxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd Company to approve the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in the case of severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately-etogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can prolong the colon announcement, patients with anamnestial obstructions or signs of an acute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required while simultaneously offering palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with whom the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not block the activity of the five studied chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous addition of CYP2D6 inductors (amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromaine, fluoxetine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences of the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least associated with almaxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">The group with the highest dose showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; no dose-effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an aloof overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies 1,132 patients who received a moderately-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide (half-life time: 7.3 hours) were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a highly-etogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly-etogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After the intravenous administration, an initial decrease in plasma concentrations results in a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed proportionally in the whole dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron to 3 consecutive days the total composition (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after the one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time delivery of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which compared to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolization have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, are involved in the Iso enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an IV single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection in healthy subjects, the total length of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human-therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, evidence showed that Palonosetron can block ion channels only in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was equivalent to the 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans) which were given daily over two years led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is used for the unique application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the narration of approval for the placing of the drug Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In microscopic examination the liver tissue damage occurs, moreover, the values of liver enzyme alanine amino acids (ALT) are abnormal in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon revealed data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">The efficacy of Alpheon has been compared to 455 patients in the study of hepatitis C patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were voiced to ensure that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease again flamed up in more patients than with the referee drug; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition to this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmation (crack or cuts), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provably or probably caused by methicillins resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarmango against this type of infection may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface to be treated should not amount to more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) inhibiting the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were considered together on skin dogs, about 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in treating abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or from infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation on the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected little infirmation, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitization or serious local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is broken off, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary infected wounds the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or degradation of the infected spot after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been reached in people after topical use on poor skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant hibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAX increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on a skunk skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued or terminated with Altargo is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied Altargo, the most common reported side effect irritation at the destination which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s lower unit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site is involved in ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide-transfer, blocking partly P-binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of reapamulin at least some infections seem questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains should be considered with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and scraped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples took place in the days 3 or 4 in adults, each before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans according to topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skimmed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsoms was mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro test on genetic mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microseed test for in-vivo-examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility for oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical applique on 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (see above), development stoxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 version of the approval application (version 6.2), is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market commits itself to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the Pharmacovigilance Plan as described in the 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and are described in the 1.8.2 of the Admission Admission, as well as all additional RMP updates that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you to quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment turns out to be on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice in case of discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gauze cover unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-fold vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and is ensured that the two doses existing vaccination plan can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by "contributing" to the immune system (the body's natural defences), as it can fight against an illness.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twinrix adults and the vaccination approved since 1997 Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within three doses of an existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to six and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 doses of vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matchiness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals so a permit for placing Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the basic immunisation with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccination, whereby the first dose is administered at the time of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher is requested for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have responded to a hepatitis C vaccination, need a refresher process as protection because they may also be protected from immune memory in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is needed, the combination vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after the primordial treatment, so that in these cases the gift of additional doses may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraarterial injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal immunisation in the gluteal muscle, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutanally as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measur- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this wording in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomercial and preservative-containing inoculation formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of Ambirix were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 up to and including 15 years, Ambirix's tolerability was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and accuracy on a calculation basis per dose of Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the addition of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects according to a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix reported about pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of toxicity per proband was comparable to 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambientxgroup was comparable to that which was observed when administering the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines reported by severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 individuals whose immunogenicity was expectable, the Seroprotectins (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 following the addition of the 3-canned vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study for 1-11 year olds one month following the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">Persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of the basic immunisation could demonstrate the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the discovery of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotect- and seroconversion rates as for previous formulation for the current formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is examined both before and after resuspening for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses Ambirix (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the vaccination date), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she will recommend three injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine series.</seg>

<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take any further medicines (including those you may have received without prescription) or if you have received / have received / or your child have received / has received / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may however be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person therefore is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, separate areas and limbs should be inoculated at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually Ambirix pregnant women or breast-feeding women are not given, unless it is urgently needed that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Just tell your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) with you / your child.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data known since the initial approval for placing on the market, the CHMP insisted that the benefits-risk ratio for Ambirix remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was put into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonium encephalopathy (cerebral damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed with food or via a gastroentertainer (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube) is given.</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study, as ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, an abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or flavor release, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonia was approved under "exceptional circumstances," because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, only limited information on this drug was available.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients showing a complete lack of enzyme already in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that is manifested after the first month of life) there is an indication for use when a hyperactive encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerances and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early-manifest lack of carbamphosphate synthetase or ornithine.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine cuccinatal synthetase deficiency should receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders because there is a risk of the emergence of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which is the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neural multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least an undesirable event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal cancer who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose limiting neurotoxicity during an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylated glutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetyl glutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetyl glutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances in the urea cycle can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyrate taken for each gram is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetyl glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Hemodialysis, the use of alternative methods of nitrogenous excretion (sodium phenylbutyl rat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (however within the first life-month) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who had already been treated before the first onset of hyperammonia encephalopathy was 100% survival, but even in these patients it was time for many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygote form of the ornithine transponylase deficiency), recovered from a hypertropic encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, was 98% survival rate.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are unlikely to be reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, whereby phenylacetylmonoamine originates.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were calculated according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis after single items as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after an intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients suffering from ureasy or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the plasma next morning after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetyl glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no lamellous effects (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (infants and children who are not able to swallow the tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or through a gastroenterologist or nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early-manifest lack of carbamphosphate synthetase or ornithine.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which is the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rats were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate), lesions were found in the pyramids cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal cancer who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetyl glutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetyl glutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fat.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetyl glutamine in patients with disturbances in the urea cycle, it can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyrate taken for each gram is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetyl glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients a further worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water prior to use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products which accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">You may not take AMMONAPS during breastfeeding as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, impaired sense of taste, loss of hearing, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest of chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an abnormal measurement value of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients submitting a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiogenic was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as cannabinomab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or one year in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or vascularization) after 30 days or one year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox in reference to all indicators was as effective as Heparin except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hiudine, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin in the treatment of ACS and for a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the placing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-elevation infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous drop of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a release of 0,5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the encroachment.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiomox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a directly followed intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus-angiogenic dose of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI surgery is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, reconstituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before use and administered intravenously quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dosage should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with medium-severe kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), the ACT value was 5 minutes after the use of the Bivalirudin Bolus without clogging in an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox may be initiated 30 minutes after completion of intravenous administration of unfractionated hay or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of low molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against ududine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially if bivalira is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see paragraph 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most hemorrhages occur in PCI patients under bivalirudin, most hemorrhages can occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) while the treatment generally occurs everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bivalira, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalira is again achieved before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregate inhibitor) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with platelets of platelets or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are to be checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, weaning or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractional heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalira group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding, as defined in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraCranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point range, which required a radiological or surgical intervention, hemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhages that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" point spots, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bivalira in 6000 patients who are PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalira group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped in table 6 according to system organ classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with bivalirudine is immediately broken down and the patient is closely meshed with regard to the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinocular inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the ion bone region of thrombine, regardless of whether thrombin is present in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, on its part, slowly split the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalira was unable to induce a platelet-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patients below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivaliruine should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST midwife infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of the angiography (at the time of randomisation) or with the PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years of age with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">In subcutaneous (under the skin), Apidra is injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm, or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot process efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lubsin differs very slightly from the insulin, and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study conducted with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot perform insulin, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied to patients who are possibly hypersensitive to insulin lubsin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the abdominal cavity area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose tolerance and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the force, the brand (label), the type of insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can trigger a change in the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Migrating a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the influence of Sympatholytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between infusion lubsin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin loss occurs in human mother's milk, but in general insulin does not come into breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed the unwanted drug cures known from clinical trials, grouped by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - welness, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or trembling, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Opens to continuously change the injection site within the injection range, as a result, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or treated by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be from insulin lubsin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with a hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellit- tus, insulin in the therapeutic-relevant dosage range of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucosity effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosity effect, just like the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lubsin has twice as fast as normal insulin and achieves complete glucosity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than a human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a comparable post-denounced glycaemic control was achieved in an application of insulin lubsin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">A better post-denounced control than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control will be achieved like with a human normal insulin which is given 2 Mi- nuds prior to the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin Less with Gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin injection at a time of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
