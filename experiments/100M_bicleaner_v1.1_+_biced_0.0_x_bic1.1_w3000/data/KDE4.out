the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you can find in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... Open the map card and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras &quot; crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , delete .
the View Filter module ( called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with Tools View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ ative , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects using the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of graphi@@ cally representing ne@@ sted hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is propor@@ tionally to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle switched over view color mode can either be depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or mapping of any other file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling within the rect@@ angle .
for tre@@ em@@ aps representation algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the View menu item listing in the area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the surface of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras &apos; gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens that allows you to set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pictures per line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to view the file name in the gallery with the image file name of the image , see if the file names are shown in the gallery .
to view the file size of the image , see if the file size is shown in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you can determine if the size of the images is shown in the gallery .
in the Dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be stored .
to include sub@@ folders with the check box , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub @-@ folders are included .
if you want to copy the original pictures to the gallery , copy the original pictures to the gallery .
to use the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings offers you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . edit capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export , and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and possibilities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to make reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialogue with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can ask questions to other users here soon . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to get started &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data file is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ cam ; you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , which contains images , as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; looks at any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; searches recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders , unless it is hidden in hidden folder . this can be done without adding a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word List to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can be digi@@ ti@@ sed , possibly b@@ yp@@ assing it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help raw camera support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk drive . the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program for digital camera communication , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras .
lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ it support is not available in lib@@ g@@ PT@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ came ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; , to provide K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ;
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ m , above the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to select the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view at the moment . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this ind symbol view is also displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored on the hard drive are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the disk , or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album .
if you have a scanner set up , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import pictures to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select Edit properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can group together under a common name . the collection you choose will be used to sort your photos by selecting collection from the tool@@ bar or sorting albums After Collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collection settings .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date .
the buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used instead .
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you then want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview panel . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My key word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . to the collection are always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each picture is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you must wait for a while , while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided where you can re@@ generate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview . what information is available , you can change the settings . select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows , which appear when you leave the mouse cur@@ sor over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the features of a photo . the screen shot in the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window .
photos are all about digi@@ tis@@ ation ; goes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your images as it fits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to these . you can reach all the features that are digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the picture context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... Select a guide to edit your photos . image editing lets you view and modify your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu . to do this , and how to adapt it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing through other image processing programs , problems can come with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store those data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest option is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview button and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , it will be moved in the tr@@ ash bin from &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del If you &apos;d rather want to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My date limit &amp; quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
key words can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list ; to fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the key words are saved in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the key words are re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the for@@ s@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a spot by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Edit keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select as the album title in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample &amp; quot ; drag and drop there . alternatively , you can also right click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords to him . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a picture with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right @-@ click on the photo &apos;s context menu and select from the Rem@@ o@@ ving Menu . the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a temporal hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a select frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next to the search box , a small lamp is the green when the search finds hits . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search did not find anything then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search that will always filter what you have entered as a search criteria .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be used in My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , just select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the search form will appear again with the search information entered previously . if you select to edit your search , the search dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select delete in the Search context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ cam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . an option can be added to this list with search group / keyword search group . any option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or at least ...
&amp; digi@@ cam ; character@@ izes each image by a long figure with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the results selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hand @-@ made color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the matching images . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this , of course , assumes your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add the illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the be@@ acon and its window will be opened .
from the preview pane , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you are using a preview of the tool@@ bar and execute Zoo or sliding operations on one of the pictures , then these are also done with the other image .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to show it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , normal dele@@ tions also work directly from the lighting console , such as the F@@ 4 file ...
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it possible for example to simply link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the cross arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area in the preview mode .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom control below the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the preview mode .
what is a digital asset management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management looks at any part of the process of following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . anyone who takes photos , scans or stores digital photos introduces a form of digital asset management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and re @-@ use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ cam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group@@ ing , backup , evaluate , sec@@ rec@@ ise , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management adop@@ ts , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer to find a particular photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend that metadata is stored in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed in the metadata settings page ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so &amp; digi@@ cam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign each picture keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense , because you can concentrate on the best photos when working .
let &apos;s start with key words , keywords , as you frequently are called by other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically set up the tree for you or past@@ ing the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another .
the diagram shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from a distance there is not even a beautiful panoramic view of the beach . if you look at it closer , then you begin to see some details , people , the place .
wow ! you start to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with an inscription for yourself to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the move of the spatial presentation is now moving with speed of light .
the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ olo@@ cation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ cam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can export with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , it should not be changed . this field does not support either comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author &apos;s title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this can be title like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is responsible for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that offers the image to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in working with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for private persons this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . digi@@ cam ; in the near future it will provide such a module for batch processing .
topics : disk defects , plate loss , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , dis@@ semin@@ ated super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled prud@@ ently and you may no longer be trusted as a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can become un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording equipment and store them in the right way . the best DVD Ri@@ ders are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . so it is about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control summary mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control environments . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50@@ GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data again to check you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s guarantee covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available on this topic : disk error study
some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s errors are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors fixed by S@@ MA@@ RT cancel the imminent break@@ up . these are especially reading errors and displacement meters . the expected lifetime amount is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electric appliances do not make up a lot of electricity , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
because an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected too . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection devices that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for co@@ axial cables of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can cause the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to continue working until the current runs again . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , One 500@@ W U@@ PS you can get for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offering with which you can store any amount of data .
you are at home in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . additionally , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies a backup and a distributed storage are included in the offer . thus , they are desktop @-@ proof .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these errors remain un@@ discovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . it is rather wor@@ rying that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ sections within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates dealing with disk failures on a low level and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard under a license for GP@@ L . we can only hope it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % in desktop systems . not@@ ebooks account for 50 % of the@@ fts .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dest file systems .
journ@@ aling fil@@ es@@ ystems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden dis@@ ruption during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology develops further , there is a natural barrier to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is deterior@@ ated . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone else responsible for data loss . thus , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before making anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hit you &apos;ll be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ fts are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , there is a common reason for loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete sn@@ apshot at two points of time : one of the total assurance and the last difference protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup is made . this backup comes with an version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only sc@@ anned and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least one month and a sn@@ apshot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC data , associated X@@ MP files , original memory , storage , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while the time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should be answered on the basis of explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ide / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the drive if needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier every year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard the GI@@ F should replace . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to standardi@@ se the camera image formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &amp; quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP matches that since it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , there can be problems when linking to the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread adoption of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it to your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a more sophisticated processing , you can use external programs . if you are editing &amp; editing the images again , you should add the metadata again , which may be cut off from other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ BO@@ .@@ In the addition of a photo to an album you will be able to add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use &amp; digi@@ cam your digital camera ; connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . for some cameras this may take a while . if the connection is made , a fer@@ rite indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the association are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file features and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ it , Manufac@@ turer , GPS , etc . this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ cam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All . this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . while downloading the photos are not deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download Sel@@ ected Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , there is a new download option available . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ came ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download or download the selection buttons , a dialog with which you can select the destination album will appear in which the photos are filed . the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums . then select the Dest@@ ination album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; downloads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the delete button . if you only want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete selected delete them .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera ; the photos will not be moved to the tr@@ ash bin from &amp; k@@ de ; they are completely deleted . so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully removed from the camera .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames in case you load photos from different shooting series into the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made in the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for dat@@ a- based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the commit will open three other options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two apply the data on the author in the default auto Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ it information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option Date &amp; time . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case when downloading . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you next time you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can use all information about orientation of the camera at the point of time to perform an automatic turn during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , it can be edited and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date at which the photo was taken , it can be used &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; this is used to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is normally off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download Button . then choose Up@@ load . the File selection dialog box appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed user who wants to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 contains many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and map references . so the question is actually more like the data in these fields coming ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about manual entry of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page , you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script working with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signatures of ha@@ iled co @-@ ordin@@ ates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to select Settings from the Settings menu ; selecting Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as is shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC data fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this may include names such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the photo offered . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image of others &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ code ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ cam ; imported without going missing .
image let@@ tering as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to indicate what file types &amp; digi@@ code , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by clicking the Ref@@ res@@ h button on the right of each category .
the settings of the optical from &amp; digi@@ cam ; can be set on this page to the default values . each time you then open the illuminated table these settings are turned on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed images . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option , you can use the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm is low @-@ loss .
even if you select the los@@ sy resolution , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ code , image editing was only one image viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly evolving into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option distingu@@ ishes the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the peak lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned down , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as a continuous white . use the setting colors resolve some unusual results , because it shows the top lights in various rose tones .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not so fast satur@@ ating as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo invo@@ icing , you should go conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ad values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction , since it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ cam ; information such as color information from one colour space to the other are to be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you &apos;re using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , that do not contain color @-@ mapping or gam@@ em@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated . this could be manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface I can &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ cuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quick Command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu in the Settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch the metadata and / or , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features on the left hand have a list of all supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the screen mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
try to see if &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the View menu of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving images into the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation from &amp; digi@@ cam ; by del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the blan@@ king of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ cam ; applied when you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen display from &amp; digi@@ cam ; under certain circumstances it acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
the setting Bei@@ m Start to search for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ tization to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if something is deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be set in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar in Settings Design . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ code , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on thumb@@ nail preview and selecting the Ad / Edit settings .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ame , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo , before you have used the Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with Save as File .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore or the button Rest@@ ore the image processing restore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last save .
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore and Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the return and note the C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image upload , image or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically
full screen view displays the photo in full screen mode . you will get to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can view it from the editing window ; view this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File Image menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or whole phrases . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Det@@ ection from the menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation buttons , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab will allow the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
in the label view , you can enter or paste in@@ scriptions with unlimited size . note the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible , which means that all special characters are allowed .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after commenting , use either the Apply or just switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button More . this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ code C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field of Re@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; session used keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword fast . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the side@@ bar keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword exists already , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the top example , the main window displays images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword has been selected from the right keyword tree to the selection and disc@@ arded . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in settings Vari@@ ed .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it needs to be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already in the database .
you can , for example , set an advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :
why are Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have adapted it mainly to &amp; digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a colour @-@ managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner to have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colour @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management , everyone would like to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should provide you with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information is available below )
your only other image editions are via e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why use another color space and think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB is emit@@ ting from s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to adjust your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , before attempting any further manual editing , use it .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Adju@@ st@@ ment and Con@@ trast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous thickness over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot are as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
the same : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes , the same results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the maximum range and a new adjustment of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a little limited because there is a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in the blan@@ king mode , which operates in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the thumb@@ nail of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram shows that it will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your score depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you enhance or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the colour chosen to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values will also be set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance to the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons make this exactly . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and relo@@ ad it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is available for the P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool will open the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to consult the color management chapter .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to also save your settings so that you can always use the same error and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the colour effects include four colour effects , a solar simulation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when a partial pressure generated a short flas@@ hing light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % of intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment eventually creates a negative picture that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar simulation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the intensity of applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a converted color film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ terr@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the colour contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can start to experiment the different colors of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse issue : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
the tool tone correction is located between the complex mould Gra@@ dation and the Simp@@ le Leu@@ k@@ thickness / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma . even if the dialogue with this tool appears very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here . concrete the three slide below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected range . below graph , three slides are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and watch out how the picture changes .
on the right hand side , the original and thumb@@ nail preview can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ ges .
the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones automatically . additionally , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
outputs : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and relo@@ aded later , using the Gim@@ p level format .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , media and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you just get the effect displayed in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . in this case , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you shift a vent@@ ral arrow to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker .
on previ@@ ew@@ ing the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you want to change this mark to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes -@@ buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set using the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed canal bl@@ ender ; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison to one &apos;s own rider .
a red marker has a red marker to preview the target image . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ anz , the image will retain the general brightness as well when you change the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the option mon@@ ochro@@ me , as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool to create great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the ey@@ eb@@ row . colour@@ less consists of small noise files that don &apos;t appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns are different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the noise first .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you just get the effect displayed in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is preserved . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to be seen .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be easily converted on the computer .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this enhances landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re@@ development in an S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ co@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tools texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief model has been set to 200 .
added &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . one way of keeping his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the distra@@ c@@ ting eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . throughout , the picture is str@@ anded with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce en@@ circles it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , de@@ can@@ ted it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a kno@@ cker effect and decor@@ atively adds an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this can also be done in multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from color space and character set with its properties as you need it . the larger the image , the greater the character set must be . finally , select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply mould sten@@ cil you can lay a template over a picture .
the Picture Tem@@ plate menu apply in image processing can be used to place templates across a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . you must , however , take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the template , simply send an email to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ cam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the templates files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template tool@@ bar .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it sharp@@ ens no little , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without a focus as well as most digital@@ ised images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process must be combined with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . SL@@ R cameras usually need more subsequent sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of sharp@@ ness while reading the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . you can use the menu entry to make more rigid .
you should be careful , however , since the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but strengthens also the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will gain further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Con@@ crete plasti@@ c@@ is@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount increase the effect .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference with it applied to an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from the sharp@@ ness and therefore f@@ law defects in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ ell@@ um = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is the use of a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focus normally reaches better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing more colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular folds work much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which leads to this the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ el@@ ae , which are far from original source pixels .
circular focus : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value 1 should yield good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very blur@@ red , but then pay attention to icons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your blur@@ red Gau@@ ß is sch . this is most often caused by a previously executed inno@@ cu@@ ous filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you have selected large values for circular focus or gau@@ ze sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations that are not immediately visible are performing but will later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the blu@@ r . for the Wiener Filter , it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ th@@ ness regulator sets the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pu@@ pill@@ ary .
the ink tin@@ ting allows a suitable colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as starting points to make the restoration easier . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to smooth smoo@@ thing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film or CCD rou@@ ge a high value can produce und@@ ulating patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the level of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture .
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is going to run . normally , 1 or 2 is enough .
angle step width &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make this exactly . correc@@ ting any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and relo@@ aded later .
correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the background that was caused by a bad film deposit during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ amt ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high sensitivity of ISO . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller fla@@ ws are cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the gap between the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved .
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter &apos;s frequency response . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise points can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without loos@@ ing details .
light density : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges , which are typically stronger . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ it@@ ting damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for this .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is luckily much easier than to shar@@ pen an image . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film particles , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that emerge in digital , original or retro@@ actively digi@@ ti@@ zed pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG data arti@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad make this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ R camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , textures were applied to an old colour photograph that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; Light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically relo@@ ad it in the next session .
the image section and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels with a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shade ) it the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also display this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use a center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ wi@@ ped effects arise through movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s films and the color and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter .
with three controls you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the dot of the largest density of the filter . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image using the gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a more fine adjustment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a light and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a proprietary algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second grade handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , flat@@ ter but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient 4th grade correc@@ ts the distant verti@@ ces to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree . negative values can be corrected to correct ton@@ ar distortion and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the magnitude of distortion . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse character of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus performs a correction of the first degree . increase negative values while positive image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion effect . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next startup .
the tone or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any changes or res@@ izing . best perform this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would be apparent to the false .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to show the dotted lines . move it to an important location such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it with the blan@@ king tool in the menu Transform@@ ating cro@@ pping from image processing or over the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective in such a way that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ like correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate inf@@ ra @-@ red film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 i@@ inf@@ rar@@ erotic movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO regulator changes the amount of film particles and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Fil@@ ming Filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film particles on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix big silver particles of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide image is 1 and G@@ lät@@ te 17 .
the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter Grav@@ ure shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a proprietary algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter Grav@@ ure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in images with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , dar@@ ing landscape .
depth allows setting the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses proprietary algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses proprietary algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen : blur@@ gs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ om@@ ising camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels by a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blu@@ r : blur@@ gs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ redness : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a lin@@ early moving , z : B : photographed from a car or train , camera .
soft markings : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking blur@@ ring : blur@@ gs the image through random shifting of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent shar@@ pen : finds the paint tank in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool for making ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing a area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it to the right orientation by mirrors or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming mirrors menu .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a picture with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes here a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform@@ ers size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image manipulation programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge Every insert for photo can be saved as text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse simply the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then move while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photo will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle create by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save files in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and width is assigned to the width of the width .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
when you use the edit tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the cooperation help make it possible to hide help so that you can put together your images better . these help are :
harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ thirds , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden Centre : the golden center is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party gel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
a further rule are the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the gold tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that unlike harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal @-@ angled tri@@ angles .
if you use gold tri@@ angles to break down your frame , you create an effect called by professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ on@@ tal mirror and mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divi@@ des .
with the Color button you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can become invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you do a photo , then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can repair this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the pres@@ et button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the picture , you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function transforming cutting out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally cro@@ pping function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option fli@@ ps the image a bit after the turn . note , however , the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ist transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview will then automatically be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the upper left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed domain .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed domain .
angle on the lower left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed domain .
angle right down : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed domain .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a bit s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing .
the tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal shift , for example , will shift the top part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left .
you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line will appear . move the mouse to an important point , such as the sea , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two en@@ grav@@ ings produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shot , the picture has ugly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ code .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; shows only files in formats to those who know . this is done with the file extension and a comparison of them with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file will be displayed in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ cam ; can be modified . see the Con@@ figuration section for more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss @-@ free if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supporting cameras can be viewed down on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capabilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback movies use to start playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ cam ; their description follows here .
all picture editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft sign , noise suppression , re@@ focus , mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . left of it allows five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left side shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally split . the upper part shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and put it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties tab displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this , of course , assumes your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ let files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten @-@ Files from &amp; k@@ de ; installed can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot custom color and last used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue Palette you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor check box is enabled under the Color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows . so if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of color sel@@ ections can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and find them in the color pi@@ cker on the left side .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and displayed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component .
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graphs is required . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be relo@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will be done as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the Settings ...
when you open a graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice and change it later .
you can also define how the graph is to be distributed across multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page will be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a page distributed on several pages without header and with another font
the Renew@@ ed Download page gives the ability to define the behavior when a file has been modified on the disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( relo@@ ad automatically or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the page Open gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened out of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the opportunity to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at every start .
the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as they are described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are :
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short as possible edge edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ coated graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ loaded layout for un@@ coated graphs . it uses the Fru@@ tiger @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the k@@ not circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give specific options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directional or un@@ executed ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for und@@ eri@@ zed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the Overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes images to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears as you can replace the default duc@@ ric image to select your image . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you read the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner .
make sure the window will be completely displayed as some settings may otherwise not be displayed .
after you have pressed the Scan@@ nen button , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window will appear to set the image file options . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select the Fol@@ der &amp; # 160 ; or create it by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the &quot; Import &gt; screen shot &quot; menu . a window appears in which you can set the various screen@@ shot modes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Complete desktop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read a single window under the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read in the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialogue options of the target image appears with the options described above .

the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . so it &apos;s your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successfully logging in , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module is exported to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access rights that the module displays . to upload , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions .
the Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press on the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts .
the key column can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the options Open , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size will be changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF words of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file , of course , contains data that were taken at the same locations in the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation lies below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ eren and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is in a big difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ related button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . because the dialog takes the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed card . select this region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Inclu@@ de this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to mount the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will display the Al@@ ben@@ ign preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image gets a separate page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your related images . for this , select a folder where you have read permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that will be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the Program@@ ming messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as twi@@ sting , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short be@@ ading and mapping . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses in quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases since no compression of color information is held . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the metadata module Import function , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata .
this feature does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please look out ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder Module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected will be included in the portfolio image files . there you can also change the contents of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is fixed below . a low value creates a very sudden , high contrast very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as far as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your needs , you can start the production of the movie with the code encoding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go quickly or calm@@ ly to enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show once you &apos;re back .
if a note appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings button at the bottom .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print out directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats : JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images or otherwise use it elsewhere you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ it information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert multiple images at once . therefore , if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ ride existing file . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation of the image . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
non Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you pres@@ elected . you can add additional images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right side .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent .
the images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can use the OK button to open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and subject to the subject .
make sure not to send too many pictures at a time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of the emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , add the comments to the images in a text file and add the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is completed , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module advanced slide show , a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant visual transitions via Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensures that the presentation will be shown in a loop loop . you can then manually ab@@ ort with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images chosen random@@ ly make sure that the images are displayed in random order , so it &apos;s not the order of the images used in the album .
between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . by chance , every transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left corner of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the lower left side of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date currently does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop interface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the picture , entries are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images on which both people are displayed are displayed . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few individual images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which is of course also valid for locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
in order to display images next to the name , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image @-@ click @-@ window ( described in more detail ) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again .
if you enter a string in the label or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you can see pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try new features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry Photo@@ album ; demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon , some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name implies , this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed posts preview page from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview list ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only display images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML menu ...
before HTML pages are created , you have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , choose if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . you can find more information on export files in .
last but not least , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer even without a description . for example , that all images are of a party .
in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page , you can set up different resolutions for the images . as a result , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 should not download images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . it can therefore search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get a larger image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and then automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible for viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will start . otherwise , the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . thus , the import function , see , correctly works you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be set in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to apply the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work will not even make it happen again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can share all images and share this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in tw@@ o@@ fold ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally move to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option on this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import file ... choose , &amp; photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described .
the Im@@ porting Wiz@@ ard consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called people . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you see images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured .
in this manual , you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options .
Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . many places in this manual are talking about images , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup to a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings box photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will be given the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols that enable you to view the preview and options for the viewer . a detailed help is available for each setting , which you can access the F1 button by pressing a button and clicking on the option you want .
it has been described in detail how to define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
view the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select an ann@@ ot@@ ation and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up full member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group are set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as stated in .
in the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ cam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be called via the Module Module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; co@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this on your own pictures The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can be accessed either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules use over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not working . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications order their images in albums : in doing so , an album is simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; .
it simul@@ ates &amp; co@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply fits the current view , i.e. all images showing you the image preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here we go and photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have created in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category of persons , so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and choose the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you have a photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you see at the top a menu and a tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the image , where the picture was taken etc . you can put any image at the same time individually or for a larger number of images . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were taken .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them when you enter information on your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , through that the names used are moved up , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to view an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon by date below the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the picture above and back @-@ buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have included multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
the picture shows a browser window showing the US as a group . to indicate that it is a group , a special icon is displayed .
in the Com@@ bat dialog &apos;s context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop there to categ@@ ori@@ ze it to a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a box by dra@@ gging it outside the window range .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options ... , which offers , among other things , the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . you can see this in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter . an example of this is shown here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit menu from the Edit menu . now the window will show you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; photo album ; namely images , without you being stored on the hard disk . of course you need to have the images stored somewhere to record &amp; photo album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk . this is for example shown in the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that you can preview these images . however , you can also not view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back . so if you want to avoid trouble , like the mess@@ ing up of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible for others and click on the Current View menu in the privacy menu .
with this , you have set which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures to be hidden , thereby removing all the images you have locked .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be typ@@ ed to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the privacy menu .
please remember that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images can be found on the hard disk , and on the other hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml may delete the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this kind of password protection serves only to deny the view of private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them and back by using the picture up and down the buttons . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus respectively minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can zoom out The plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the zo@@ oms result .
with the Stop button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key key , zoom in so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work with videos are that you are in and out with the plus and minus button .
you can rotate the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
when you view images it can happen that you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter those names . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you view one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . so , if you have all the images you are editing , printing or whatever you have chosen , you simply put all the pictures at one time . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you allow &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted one later .
in order to close the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture , select from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should necessarily read and understand .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ al views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert Menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will appear , so that you can select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error message . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to ren@@ der@@ ate a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a Wire Model . you can set this value relative to the level of view of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the visible stage of the scene selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple windows directives and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , pull the window to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the set@@ ter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , pull the set@@ ter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map in the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , pull the p@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left pointing arrow in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
you can save the current window view with the view pane ... save it . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ der@@ . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene .
R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select View R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , then the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that allows you to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the picture , select the section below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the Quality drop down sel@@ ector , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used to render . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as default is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive , because the super @-@ sampling refers to the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
fields of activity : abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further followed and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to create noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene select the menu entry File Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ RA@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ RA@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the object &apos;s source code into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . enter the path to your document retention and version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high @-@ level data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick the high level of detail for extended projections , all the wi@@ re@@ model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
if you want to display wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you mark the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you want to activate channel smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more details about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing windows or create new window classi@@ fications . in the window classi@@ fications section it is explained how you can create and save window classi@@ fications .
drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : shows all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the Exist@@ ing window classi@@ fications list shows all existing window classi@@ fications . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window @-@ arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created by the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with cartridge you will get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the Edit menu item .
this is the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . this shows you the results of the scene rendering .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change the basic camera settings , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points that allow you to change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you click the Apply or the En@@ ter button , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example you could insert a rect@@ angle ( insert End@@ licher body Qu@@ ader ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then click the Apply or the En@@ ter button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ model view now shows the level , even if at the moment only as a limited final level . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shifting .
in this scene you should move the soil to the exercise one unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please choose first sub @-@ object . the pigment will then change in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the thumb@@ nail you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the disk and the ball in the preview , just click the Apply button and then get the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the check@@ er@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to execute this step as you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( Don &apos;t forget to press the En@@ ter button or the Apply button ) , the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material .
if you have chosen the sphere , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
the brightness effect and reflection settings already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when Met@@ alli@@ sh : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to produce a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera ; the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a source of light you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Rest@@ ore .
save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , key short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return button .
you can set each image to be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first characters of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in dialogue Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of work &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set down below . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still have the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; at the end the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
here are the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the index cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows great icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user &apos;s part contributing to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; make it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry to report problems or requests . this shows a dialogue with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users here . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best way to get involved in &amp; show@@ photo is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ picture ; to access these settings , you need to select Settings show@@ picture ; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sc@@ lite ; is an application for scanning pictures that no longer does as images scan and save .
&amp; sc@@ lite ; is a simple application for scanning pictures that no longer power as images to scan and save . &amp; sc@@ lite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels lite ; with the command gu@@ inea -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialogue to select the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly address these options .
in order to scan a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the picture , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the Scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image is displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and sc@@ lie ? en leads to a departure and you get back to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button will open the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option before saving must display a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channels lite ; images can be selected . open Di@@ alogue to save for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; output lite ; it is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the option of saving without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as a default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is recorded each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; inea lite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; inea lite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; greeting .
&amp; gu@@ inea lite ; licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by and sc@@ lite ; attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
you may want to set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands work . thus , you make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break might look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error _ &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should assist each K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes a new piece to be picked up . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ti@@ cked paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ti@@ te ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; end , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clean@@ up operations , such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ap@@ point your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permission :
if your script package is complete , you can app@@ end it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus . maybe you just search for a particular title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult for you , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , there are some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without difficulty in setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
in addition , if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ les . the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
create atmosph@@ eres : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ win@@ .@@ This will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
cast mood files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ les compiled . if this setting is enabled .@@ mood files are stored in the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; it should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist while you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is saved .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece visi@@ bly to keep the playlist window open / un@@ rolling to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
changing part changes to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; by selecting Custom Scrip@@ ts , the otherwise gray outlined section is activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector , which is activated , for foreground and background color .
playback at startup causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece at the place it has been stopped during the last ending .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if custom colors are not enabled , the default &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the Kar@@ tei@@ map audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate further adjustments in this card .
the Kar@@ tei@@ Library collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the database type for the collection .
here you can select the folder which is &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively search sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enable &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( for example , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the playlist browser .
the Part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , additional setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; under Calcul@@ ator : will type the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under Port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar performers can be called to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of functions and gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager controls the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but Flu@@ x@@ box will provide difficulties for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by checking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a little more mature .
make sure all libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not use it as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repe@@ ating / dynamic play@@ lists ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ .@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are easily resolved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # am@@ aro@@ k channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error if you have something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; appears just a blank playlist . how do you get into music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the GUI intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column show rating . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press En@@ f on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist to the playlist and drop it down , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , you can save the playlist to the playlist . click on it .
you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also check for lib@@ aries , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) and you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used a Back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be Which Media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng !
it may ! maybe you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with no MP3 decoder in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Backup 1 &apos; . OK ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa heat@@ sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and output audio at the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
it does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable sound &amp; multimedia sound system settings . enable sound servers with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and crashes . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run the follow @-@ up register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg file , compile and install it . then run the Fol@@ der register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the m@@ peg @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the follow @-@ register .
please report this to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; playback . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed by the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; current titles when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be dis@@ connected from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; window . please press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the queue in the queue . by pressing the input key after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . for normal read@@ out , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead use files from folder mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically this is the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the valuation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the dialog metadata .
the developers do not want to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means K@@ DE packages have a pre@@ defined release plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also a lot of bug reports .
probably it became &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install it .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re @-@ installed but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that separates the development files from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
you can use it for a long time . p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter x@@ ine us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b looks after the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio edition of Arts is not supported further . of course , you are allowed to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed supervis@@ or for Arts : )
listen to music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for certain items . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them by using the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the playlist window tool@@ bar .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist &apos;s browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , please select Action Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD tracks in WAV format . simply drag the .@@ wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function also exists in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . here you have different possibilities for burning a CD .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages will be listed that make work with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains several browsers that allow you to capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current running piece or current stream . just below it is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time of the play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can change by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control , and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or the volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playing and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own default settings .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use the E@@ quali@@ zer Tools from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of features deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you might notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information displayed there are now divided into other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; also , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( extras Statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the album cover picture and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its valuation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display covers images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five most evaluated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current performer that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
in the text sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts written from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try and am@@ aro@@ k ; if there is no text script running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group interpre@@ ts - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see conver@@ sions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list of different interpre@@ ters .
group Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your tunes will be sorted by genre and by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
the last button lets you change the collection settings . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically re@@ vise your collection once you change something to the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces this might take a while .
there is a search filter right under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection field with which you can filter out the most recent additions to your collection . you can select different time windows , ranging from the last 24 hours to one year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This will emp@@ ower the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this function will add the selected pieces to the queue , so you will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , refer to the Media Player browser section .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Met@@ adata ( for n ) ... - Works the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the composition - Select the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in different interpre@@ ters .
note the compilation mark - Change a compilation of marked album back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed by Vari@@ ous performers but again under the associated performer .
the playlist browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intelli@@ gent Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Intelli@@ gent Play@@ lists are possible . click Add Intelli@@ gent Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connection with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces sorted on your iPod to performer in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the artist &apos;s list . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list , all files that do not match your search criteria are hidden .
in the bottom part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick up music from an entered URL . for example , if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input key , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces attached to play . you can change the order by simply drag and drop the entries . once you enter letters , only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , you will find &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all the pieces that contain one or two or three are found ( or combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : - Som@@ e@@ thing looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this looks for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and then right click in the desired order to click the entries . the entries then receive a lab@@ eling with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar tool bar is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left side you can add the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , follow the undo and restore buttons . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration via this menu .
there are many more buttons available for the tool bar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars there ... Select options .
the Status Bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist .
a click on this entry will open the visualization plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select :
the queue management received your great move in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ specified ( the details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding more random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double @-@ click the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then choose loading . thus , your current playlist will be replaced with the new playlist . so , you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist received pieces starts with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
the New Fil@@ l button cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not enabled , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped , and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces that have already been played will be removed .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , you will add &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists mentioned .
some scripts make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k scripts , by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open , in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new script will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please have a look at the writing of Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps , you need to have a smart installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that when encoding an audio CD you will receive a po@@ orer quality no matter how high the bit rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog window , you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the machine has completed the firing process .
this Quick Start Guide will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the library search path ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; there you can get feedback , draw on community help from the forums and learn news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally called Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
standard : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can result in the un@@ beautiful effect that the pieces of music will be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , where you can select folders and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every individual project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project is changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and change . furthermore , you can cancel the project and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what is to happen , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
close all opened projects and exit &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it , as if you called a file closing .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files that are added appear in the base folder of the CD .
the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described on the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this function will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialogue . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD , which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD using the copy dialog . converting / decreasing a DVD by means of the copy dialog will not yet be supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the total ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be fired at once by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks , and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow@@ er range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , the key signature can be adapted further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this you need to enter your system administrator privileges , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for custom@@ izing and adjusting the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled e.g. via a shell script .
to use the d@@ co@@ p &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the programs you prefer .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
void j@@ ec@@ re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void / void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received via the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void p@@ add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set@@ u@@ id ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ ank / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many en@@ co@@ ders that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed in the MP3 or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it needs to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders have to be installed . all these programs are usually present for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself .
which coding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to en@@ co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the CD ; it is not possible to read a protected audio CD ; read out . in any case , &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying Cop@@ y @-@ protected audio CDs ; s !
while setting up has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , then the daily use to read a &amp; CD is explained ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stum@@ ble over at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . step by step example , you can find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
CD@@ DB request of CD data starts according to the set up of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - when an en@@ coder is configured in the code Settings tab in the Settings dialog - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different en@@ coder than the default . note that previously the En@@ coder was configured in the Settings dialog in the Settings dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already @-@ read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as logs , be@@ eps ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences become less important as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex tracks of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or downloaded by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of application settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; can be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read and enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it should be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note by the translator ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the CD ; information published on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; used for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror @-@ server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not yet happened .
for saving the read WAV files , the code@@ c and therefore the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the coding .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ver can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a coder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read reviews on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio processors of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; you want to read it out . check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you have to install c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , since it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg , by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that is supposed to be done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what for each end @-@ to @-@ end &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the audio format used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program that fre@@ ed@@ b to use around the CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reader program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device desig@@ nations for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen shot .
just ask for incomplete information , so you will be notified when information on generating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD to download data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b host .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; record found , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand . however , to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for downloading &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how do the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but since many fire@@ walls bu@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 protocol since the protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want &amp; CD ; submit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
disc@@ ard CD ; after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom Fol@@ der for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not crossed , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :

this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described how the process of reading the CD is running on the hard disk . we will create a connection to the Internet as we are comfortable and want to pick up the CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process described in this section must be repeated for each end @-@ end &amp; CD ; repeat .
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to enter instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; matches .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered into the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply jointly for all pieces of the CD .
note : after successfully retri@@ eving data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ generate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ co@@ ders or file formats . see the editor &apos;s help to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the end @-@ to @-@ end CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are available under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second one .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the Tit@@ le Data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and album will be displayed on the BO@@ M list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked will be read out . a simple click on the line to@@ ggles the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the button All the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at a time .
if the selection process is started by clicking the button selection , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a co@@ aster you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that were not successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder aren &apos;t what we entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format . thus , read out and coding in parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with performance @-@ weak machines the result is unclear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( of though two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order placed in the queue of the co@@ aster . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is currently being enter@@ tained within the k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to people compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it about ? if you read this , you probably have already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version of a manual for &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke experience .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound Project Driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of any MIDI channel activity by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the play menu , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played back one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid plays a piece , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and running with the slider back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and to the right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , press the space bar like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu entry break in the play section , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and other both . some pieces have no lyrics : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually set it manually . so , if you want to enable automatic text selection in the Settings menu , it will automatically change the kar@@ aoke text . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to set an event type , select the entries of text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you summari@@ ze . these are played after the series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ized ... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the each one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not stored . remember when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to the Add button . it will appear in the file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection .
if automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence according to the collection sequence from the main menu , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the next song from the menu , or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song backwards , select the button Pre@@ y piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and will always sound a trumpet if a piano was originally intended to play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM modes and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A more Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI will be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that the term &quot; drum patch &quot; refers to the patch in which each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the rows is very important as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used above all to map the sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . see for example the included Key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do that in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be defined with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all the events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
if a MIDI file sends a pitch ben@@ der event with the value n , it will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed it . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that the map file doesn &apos;t have decim@@ al comm@@ as .
this setting is needed because GM anticip@@ ates that a keyboard that gets a pitch ben@@ der event will play with the value 40@@ 96 , a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave above . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a number of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you will see which sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and to the right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid , compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
before that , enable Automati@@ cally Ad@@ ding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid . first , you only want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Ad@@ ding to the collection and open A.@@ D. . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , making music and proving pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me feel great if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list them ( if you want to ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; mid ; completely written in my free time and won &apos;t give money to anyone for it . I would like to emphasize that I only programmed myself because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends substantially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to compile it with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . when you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and persistent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and select the next edit mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose the playlist by playlist and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
animation while star@@ ing and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation while starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the ad of one favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ . &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f . &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the K@@ M@@ Player tool@@ bar . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , such as setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog will be specified by K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the Browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
for example , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b inside .
since the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also possible only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ version , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any way I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is run as user root after the device is inserted . it is essential to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably applied to the package &amp; text ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact via the box should be established .
if you have any questions regarding the compilation of &amp; ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ y ( eng@@ l lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . around &amp; lat@@ ex ; properly mastered , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } again .
the quick entry Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also set some settings related to the document .
document classes : this is used to specify the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ b@@ r &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ b@@ r &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
code : this sets the character encoding . it should be used to use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used accessory pack@@ ets for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for inclusion , they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used when creating German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and more information about this are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is saved through the modest appearance of the output file .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically generates a blank line ( for typing the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful for back @-@ up . once a DVI @-@ file ( D e V ice I n@@ r file ) is created , skip &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output format of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are added to the editor , and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section is jumped to the corresponding section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other included .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on an all @-@ in @-@ device , all @-@ in @-@ all , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick build .
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large boxes should be found . the selection fields have been developed for the rapid classification of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick link of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box for further information is available for items such as keywords , notes notes or references . the available options are :
description : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element will be created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice above a selection field ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ m e is used for defining the font . it is possible to specify the fon@@ ts for the main text , marks , etc .
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the building or the push button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically saves storage .
if compilation of the document fails , it should be sought in logging after the errors . when using high @-@ speed build &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , also the logging should be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . if , for example , a report with the font e 12 is created , and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow you to change the font in the environment .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , you can add certain fon@@ ts , bold prints , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics and is long enough until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le will follow .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better legi@@ bility of the document . for this purpose , a quote , a few places in bold and ital@@ ics and a poem may be applied to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI @-@ file is created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ r ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as Pr@@ inters , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is configured correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar opens the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . to do this , only Modern settings must be set up under Settings ... Tools Construction will be selected .
in order to execute the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on the preview search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then executed .
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document from &amp; ki@@ le ; opened and jumped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( configur@@ ing ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error , there may be errors . if there is an error , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file tells the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can use the &apos; Previous La@@ Te@@ X Er@@ r@@ ors &apos; and Next La@@ Te@@ X errors for le@@ aps between the errors . the log file always lists the line in which the error appears . to view the fla@@ wed line , you must click on the error in logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the wrong line .
once you click on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when choosing blank documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
Frequ@@ ent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File Tem@@ plate from document ...
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings General can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in a document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , the custom template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below will be executed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate , as an internal editor . &amp; kate . is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about posters ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted with Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be accessed over the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; and their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that in this way , when you click \ \ par from \ \ big@@ .exe , only \ \ par will be selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the various kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can insert additional jump marks . these are an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items Edit Her@@ bs or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although there are already excellent possibilities , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has always been added .
this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; Ki@@ le is that the slots are separated by two blank lines .
select the word from the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning as this command also displays &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected and removed by pressing the Del@@ f button . &amp; Po@@ sters ; provides the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands here for a faster option . under Edit Rem@@ ove , the following commands are included to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to Edit Sel@@ ected paragraph .
it has been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands in editing environment for a more accessible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to lie@@ ject the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or inside the command \ \ begin { surrounding } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command ful@@ fills the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by braces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded closing clamp .
if the cur@@ sor jumps before or behind the sharpen@@ ed clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted , welded groups par@@ enth@@ eses , the overview can quickly be lost . this command ful@@ fills the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as a guide . for the purpose @-@ purpose implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple quotes . &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two key stop signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic single @-@ click sign can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign language specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French quotes . there are also many more languages available .
when using Shift ; input key for &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
in a table environment complete t &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added to Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; according to the next tab in the underlying line .
although &amp; kate ; already provides a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; to add special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of these work on demand and the other two are for automatic complete destruction . all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } will become &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the back button is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed , and it is possible to change the list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from &amp; ki@@ le ; also jump marks can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible with the Edit jump mark N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jump mark and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Block ; Complete can be made settings to these lists . you can select different registry lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as words of general language use .
command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the Call of Full Stop mode will result in a large e list with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when exec@@ uting full @-@ time mode over the volume modi@@ fying environment or pressing Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically fired and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; again , recognize that this is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Block ; Complete can be made settings to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ ter List of Dest@@ ination Mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of deriv@@ ations that are immediately replaced with longer strings . lists can be set up under Settings box ... le For@@ ms can be set up . as an example of a check list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word is started in full @-@ time mode over the volume of full @-@ volume cooling or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large e walls are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been established that many of them are written more than once in a document .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... T@@ ables can be de@@ activated . here , the threshold value for displaying complete damage can also be specified .
the corruption files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphi@@ cs dialog box forms the entry of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as familiar as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all the tools are compiled in groups in the Cre@@ ating compile , creating change and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the second conversion can be used the key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick build command , a viewer is usually called upon the compile . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be launched about the project New Project .... In this case the following information will be asked for the project :
when filtering the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path of the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file must be specified .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows execution of the EC@@ MA@@ script code . scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed yet and can be modified in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents , including documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and thus is ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / ly@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / ly@@ live ; the small application tex@@ tur@@ t@@ k containing a database with all documents and boxes ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , causing &amp; ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; License .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface you can create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is derived from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig will be read for the whole day . for each day use it to use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique email .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section ; and add your new signature in the lower section . signature @-@ example kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click on the Save .
you can create as many signatures as you wish . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail applications like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails at home or on a professional basis , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross in the tool@@ bar .
in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button at the bottom of the button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signatures from the output of a command .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how superior it is . if we take it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the war@@ y working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , anyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then you simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported bugs and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply attached . if not , delete the check in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ format@@ ted file is well @-@ format@@ ted , click the Well @-@ For@@ med review option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , choose &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file be selected . if not , remove the selected current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have been named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . by adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose who he is from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after which they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for more information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see how such ladder will be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note input is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment field followed by comment text .
note can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the recru@@ ited top name of the team member , is a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the characters are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic is supported and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog covers some pages that are dealt one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including car completion can be modified .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : when checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and end tag automatically : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Standard button , default specifications can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise open files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . this setting , however , is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties when a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties when a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default window settings back to the default in the next start is useful when the user interface is mess@@ ed up by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can define the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see for the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the depic@@ tion of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structure tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the update frequency of the tree to edit and how deep can be opened automatically when changing the structure tree . empty knots are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
the area for setting short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded while editing . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the i@@ f@@ clause ing@@ ron@@ ym stands for something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
the plu@@ gins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known and kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard site like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . pick it possible even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been dis@@ continued , as is the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action will make the link to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bu@@ gging is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next command in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next script in the script , where possible , if possible , in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were no current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
document type edit pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented lef@@ to@@ vers of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , the text and instructions are more quickly inserted into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a method name and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag may occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag that can be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above is in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this feature is currently not available yet . currently , verification takes place only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be re@@ achable via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Ver@@ turn@@ 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . clicking on New Action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut that has been assigned to this action . by clicking the user definition button a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with one , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) to be started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ sq@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ .@@ This way you will find : global script folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if only one instance runs , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to the standard input . in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input .
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
the output of the application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted according to the input . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard output . it can be specified what is to be done with the output written to the standard output by setting the output selection box :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the given case it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action Button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them , enable dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly icon . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels as standard , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit Size below .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regards to the day &apos;s start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will be a &amp; lt ; star@@ t@@ gt ; tag in the current document will be added .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings set actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the application button and continue with other tags , if there are any ones , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators .
after selecting the item that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview window . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by absor@@ bing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the appropriate file .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you prefer . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cs file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these document@@ aries e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources can be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used to form context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function will be shown . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use .
if you are sure they are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at various locations there is an email , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where everyone else &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user can download them . to make an individual contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource , you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , up@@ loading tool bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in XML format . there is a simpler way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adapted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring these concepts closer to them without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . from tool@@ bars about actions , everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific samples and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that only this user can use them personally .
project @-@ related items are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ Pat@@ terns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the project &apos;s folder tree , which allows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the car@@ ers with information and tool@@ bars . please suggest , and for more detailed information about these areas .
you can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tab , relo@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
sp@@ li@@ ts in the Editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , help to Word under the mouse cur@@ sor , or Open the File , if the string under the mouse poin@@ ter refers to a file .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog box .
the building man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the representation with car@@ ts are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building man@@ views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be carried out with the context menu that appears .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , parts of the program , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here as well . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an item , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking an item , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and re@@ fres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree view . with it man@@ ly can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add project @-@ specific documentation , edit and view .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab at the bottom of the window to be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a host of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now widely on the way to a universal and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim has to be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows Web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
to learn more in the details , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help help@@ s@@ help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the Tem@@ plates section . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; en@@ rolling so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; en@@ rolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
turning and switching off the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
shows the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document .
book@@ marks made from other open documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with file extension .@@ web@@ bla@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , are managed by the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project file / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this will only create the name . actions need to be set by setting actions ... to be added . tool bars are stored on tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team for the tool bar to be available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load A &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; re@@ plen@@ ish without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the tags / actions list on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag creation dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bar is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plugin menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in will disable it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; version .
very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the current document &apos;s syntax based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or create un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the index card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode corresponding to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you can find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and modify the sequences .
this should create a help in line with the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ bla@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ bla@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content that you want to download and change . if you have failed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
leave if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clip from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about the project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger Plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub @-@ window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by atta@@ ching time to its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behaviour cannot be influenced at present .
to open another project , select Project ... from the menu Project or the icon Project will open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ bla@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project file is automatically stored . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening ... in the context menu with the right mouse button :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and will be forgotten in the end of the program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the disk store option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high@@ lighting profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialogue is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply moving the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool tool@@ bar tool tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own working method .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are the best tool for custom@@ izing the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool bars is treated below in the Add tool bar section below .
tool@@ bars and symbols can be adjusted either by means of context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created . other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog where it can be specified , which actions should be visible on these or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries remove action and display action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set settings .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code escal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , in about the restrictions that one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; templates supplied have conditions for their use . please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before using .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more specific documents are made in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples may be found in template tree under global templates .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can contain everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ basis . some examples are found in template tree under global templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole web sites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template , save as local template ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click in the file tree or in the project file tree view to a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure . by default it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented procedure . you can specify he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or associate files with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps /
to set a folder &apos;s behavior in the template list , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden when par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template list . if a root folder was set in such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or submitted text for templates in this folder . this may be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , and by copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally you have context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) about a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , offset the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time interval can be set . basically , the recommendation : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so you can select the document properties . this allows the processing of invisible tags during work with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this can be changed :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the modification of the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keywords Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is the same as in a word processor , due to moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the selection works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and by means of push@@ button or removal button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way across the tool@@ bars , such as the source text editor . it must be noted that tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other ar@@ mature tag .
some tool@@ bars like the She@@ ets Wiz@@ ard or the Listen Assistant are disabled , and will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be tra@@ cked .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is loaded , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
this command checks for a partial or entire match with a preference called QNAP or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested holding point must be termin@@ ated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are checked again shortly after the start of each flow .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot more useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with automatic selection of the correct changes . the merge editor under the differences window allows you to edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
the opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) , or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will notice your selection and will show it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
by selecting a folder , you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , however , for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field becomes active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately set an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting with the compare / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison starts immediately .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and drop it over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would only need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small help window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed over the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column of the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is represented on frac@@ tional lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription form : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ changes &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
sometimes , by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing , there is no more line left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line in the queue is displayed . this is only a wild@@ card for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark you might copy and add somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navigate in one of the windows , you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side up , side down , start , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the Au@@ dition Window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge and edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if it is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , because you may over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line end@@ ings are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line @-@ ending of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when moving and restored at the next start . ( menu Setup - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides scrip@@ tures with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
when activating this option , differences in itali@@ c font are displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ray . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically displays an un@@ just color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press En@@ ter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is checked , any selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copying the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which line end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return character is made visible , but as a white character is treated . during mer@@ ging this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search inten@@ sely for even minor differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic @-@ forward mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before going on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then you better use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details under documentation about the folder comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you have to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and re@@ boot so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
in the selection fields for coding a short reference appears , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing instructions , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit un@@ ic@@ ode , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn off to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded rol@@ lover column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second check column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison windows next to each other or over one another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge again , the name of the last file used will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user greater flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre@@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / ZIP &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data visible by the new@@ line algorithm .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the comparison and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only have to specify the folder on the command line or in the dialog box .
if three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 will be used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
when you read the folder , you will be notified of a small message box about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that date are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list box with the results on the left side , ...
every file and folder found in the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by double clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can fold and all sub@@ directories can open up or fold up all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders have the same color . for folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
synchron@@ ize mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and if the files are different , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , one file is executed one after the other . the Status column displays finished when mer@@ ging has been successful , and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected happens . when mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the merge is al@@ right .
if the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( including all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode C is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge B is chosen as the target and A and / or B will be used as a target for synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . they can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box with the options appears , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you only want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , leave &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option of selecting another action for the entry or solving the problem in a different way before continuing to merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern typ@@ ed , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern typ@@ ed , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ors . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
in case of links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links point . this is down@@ lighted in default .
with links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folders and searched for recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled by default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) Complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ gel@@ ation date and file size . however , this speed benefit will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the trusted date of the change @-@ date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal . for example , this may be useful when copying the change @-@ date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled by default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the later file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is presum@@ ed that the other file has not been changed as well . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will also be deleted without a backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can move the divi@@ der to the mouse with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want that , you can disable the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the folder &amp; text windows between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a menu entry in the list menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the current file mer@@ ging from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be restored and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol it uses . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts with the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ de@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ de@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ diffusion Part . note that it doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or how to go .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not to be identical . if simil@@ lines appear next to each other , this is done , but this is often the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort therefore has been too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text , suddenly , no sr@@ c has been removed ; no sr@@ c has been removed , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diffusion on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3 sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with compile . however , if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) Cop@@ ies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Pa@@ ste ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
show differences only : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also leads to the fact that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , exit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has to set up the two entries p@@ ager ... and exit . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , then the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and exit . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when you click on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is indicated together with name , the names will be marked with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty buttons are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal and vertical line , which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their contents and move . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up the switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign it to a value . possible values are :

this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the picture shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting , increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter such as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you press the &amp; Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; C@@ mag ; possesses a lot of features . you can send the magni@@ fied image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the display update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; C@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files , opening a new window , printing , relo@@ ads ( with the button document relo@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size reduction &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use an area of the screen as if you use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary equipment , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and clicks when you stop the movement .
if the smart move is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; take a break after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the move , before releasing the mouse button . this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging on with pressed mouse button . this way , the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intelli@@ gent Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after holding down the mouse button , the mouse button will wait before the mouse button is pressed again if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through the mouse @-@ shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving leads to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start from &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to launch a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the user &apos;s last push .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart shift should be switched off at first . if you then have used to the automatic click , you can later move the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first of all , you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you wish to use them again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick here is that you do not just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you should be able to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using intelligent shifting in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click on your own . thus , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in a different position .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor anywhere you want it . however , park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of mouse &amp; eg can no longer cause the mouse clicks to be triggered causing unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to mark this way text , paste it into cli@@ p@@ board or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will likely only cause problems . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , mark the text by clicking at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this time , whenever &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when , when moving smart , the delay time begins . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; be installed . that should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and who cause pain to the jaw@@ s of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a drag process before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program where dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sets which are to be spoken again .
on the first side of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , please refer to the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pas@@ sage@@ . from the text passages you can choose often used text passages without typing it . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ break@@ .@@ reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ break@@ .@@ is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you are mouth watering , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences which are to be spoken again .
with menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ break@@ .@@ This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding with which the text is passed to the language generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth &amp; mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your speech generator . see App@@ endi@@ x for examples .
if it is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text pas@@ sage@@ book or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage is directly spoken with the selection of In the input field . the selected text passage is first entered into the input field with the selection of In the input field .
with the second selection box closing the editing window for text passages , you can determine if the text pas@@ sage@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ book stores , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ book is not stored . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ book is to be saved .
the word completion page contains a list of words for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
using the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books , or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
choose the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ break@@ .@@ Then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly launched words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the top part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of text or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ sage@@ book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text will be cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory will be used .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory will be used .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory .
when this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool bar is mounted above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ break@@ .@@ If not checked , this status bar is hidden .
when this menu entry is enabled , a mov@@ able bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is arranged above the editing window directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you did not enter the command for the speech output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the Kar@@ tei@@ menu Voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etts . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to extract the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the full command is more costly than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / m@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option to send the data as default input must be enabled .

the ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the Voice Command ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read before and select in the main menu Tools Text . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible brands will also be read .
in &amp; kate , the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text you want to read , and select text in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ ty is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events that you have set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read out .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel , in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ ty differ depending on the application .
filter for string replacement offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong @-@ stressed or fla@@ wed messages to correct . the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent specific short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the orders will resume .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the output of the warning .
news is the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who is entering the room .
the rest are simple text orders . any order you want from the postcard jobs is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for issuing longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except for screen editing . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reading , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be even more types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is delivered with pre @-@ defined string substitute filters which enable the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or format@@ ting messages from &amp; convers@@ ational ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in translation of &amp; X@@ HTML , in SS@@ ml .
with language selection filters you can send jobs depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that has the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the speaker card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules after which it is used for a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning , or a &amp; k@@ de ; alert is sent , it will be processed by all the activated filters installed on the bottom . the processing by the filters occurs in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the following setup di@@ alogs .
you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for setting string replacement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . upper and lower case is not considered when comparing .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it must only be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Res@@ et column . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here for the text order . click the button to display a list of languages .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ id running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only type copies .
the string replacement filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen Filter box if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be del@@ im@@ ited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PA@@ TH environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker that is set up on the speaker card or a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that lyrics should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program gives , which sends the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to correspond to the desired requirements most likely . click the button on the right to display the speaker choos@@ er dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the voice selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen Filter box if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , can give program@@ mers their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the speech output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my speech . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , but if the module is used for festival websites , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found about the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause mistakes in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ l wel@@ ds are spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain notes or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS works with every speech syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . also look at the kt@@ ts website ; , for information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program uses a customizable module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you wish to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ code , or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the sp@@ d @-@ conf shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program ct@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can walk back , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected .
when you click Add to Add on the Kar@@ ate Map , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Kar@@ tei@@ menu speaker unit will be displayed . as an example , the module for Interactive Festival Interactive will be shown below . details on the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is contained in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text submitted to festival . for voices that are familiar to the festival , this setting is made automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slider lets you adjust the volume , voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some of the controls and display it in grey , the voice you selected does not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check@@ box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system field as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the spokesperson ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can set or return sub@@ stitutes in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be adopted and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text jobs are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or dict@@ ated without support for the appropriate audio module , cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ ml ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . in order for these adjustments to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose default .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; handles four types of speech orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after reading the output of the screen reader , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ break@@ .@@ is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ break@@ .@@ Sti@@ ll greet someone who is entering the room .
when a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and output of screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card message will appear .
check this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is checked , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read before .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected a custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the Kar@@ tei@@ menu speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default messages as follows :
use the Save button to save the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Download button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , voice speed , volume , gender , voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of language abbrevi@@ ations .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice used in the SS@@ ml issue .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ ml ; s@@ sh text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this way &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limit detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as default , a set limit detection filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add more set limit detection filters , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying out . turn on the speaker selection and select text to read . turn on the speaker selection , change some features and check how the speaker is selected . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can then pause or cancel orders on the card &apos;s card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
syntax check filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab@@ s are removed automatically from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit detection filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers .
if you have removed the normal set limit detection filter from default , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts ;
on the speaker choos@@ er menu , you can over@@ write the speech settings for the application . the card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top@@ most on the card speaker ) . in other words , there will be no talk features defined .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the characteristics of an appointed subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most likely corresponding to the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may wish to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all features in the Spe@@ aker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker and then use the speaker which is most likely to match the following .
in this case 0 for the last word order is in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was termin@@ ated . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music with another application at the same time . when I hold a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent concur@@ rent opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ue / vocals . as a guide you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be so@@ x installed and discover@@ able via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card for subscri@@ ber setup . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file will reject the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ml to S@@ aber . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can go back or back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; I can no longer set or return on the tab . on the tab orders it is displayed , the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you must not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation point , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and let it read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you pause a text order and start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not support any real p@@ auses yet . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet .

before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check whether your speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is generally good , and the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software into festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 bit ) code , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; lin@@ ux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival to be the first one on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates these from &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts di@@ phone . further information can be found at .
in this case , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; Fol@@ ders are installed , but in the Fol@@ der Festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of the error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ in@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; -@@ package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation a new module network settings at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing &amp; Linux ; if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option Network Set@@ ting at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when the module &apos;s network settings start , this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best corresponds to the distribution and release strip . by checking the setting no @-@ again the definition can be made dur@@ ably . then , the next start of network settings will be pres@@ et automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the module &apos;s entire functionality is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
tab Network Interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the device you want in the list and clicking on the interface ... in the Di@@ alogue device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are performed at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the option manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface on bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . ping an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched off as required . switching on an off @-@ switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and des@@ elect interface ...
speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed , or changed . DNS entries can be placed in priority by selecting a entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons on or down in the priority list .
by clicking the Add ... from the group host to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group host to the name resolution , select an entry and then click Edit ... It will display dialog Edit .
the list Nam@@ ely known computers describes the host name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during bo@@ oting when there is no DNS server available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of Nam@@ ely familiar hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in test version of IP is supposed to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well known machine has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit ... Edit the Find dialog box will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module &apos;s network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , you need to set the following command in a &amp; Con@@ sole :
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section can not replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point that fits a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be arbitr@@ arily chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = one &apos;s own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part you find the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL links than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . a different stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which furthermore provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it has to be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat . this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat - dis@@ semin@@ ates the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognizes &amp; co@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing on the band is not , you will be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; co@@ dat , the pre @-@ tension@@ ing man , searches for the appropriate index on your record . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape is included . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by hat@@ ching the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the strap , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; co@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the band , that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . this process requires that a tape must be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the band of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives are not .
after entering the band name and the capacity , the tape continues ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all the data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format process the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files listed in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Veri@@ fy ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate recovery , the files that are to be recovered will need to be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you confirm the settings for restoration , the dialog appears Rest@@ ore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file by means of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed in backup files , only the files located within the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be filed separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file systems .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new sn@@ apshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , the order is transmitted and vali@@ dated ; before the tape is mounted the command will load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try to lock the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . possibly this setting doesn &apos;t work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , it is automatically ej@@ ected when the tape is loaded . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy spre@@ aders .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat , change the hardware @-@ bearing block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you need to be able to communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file folder .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access , for example , to information about issues that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of specific programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the screen@@ shot below , it provides functions for easy filtering and sorting of the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - is not shown , and it opens instead of its a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely do not have access to system administrator privileges . the protocol files normally do not have permission to read under Linux .
you can also use the filter strip to filter to a selected criterion or string . to do so , enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed , so that only the log lines are displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . in addition , select the name of a process in the protocol file system protocol , and then carry out &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of level hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned off the setup dialog .
if you want to display only a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter strip .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to see all the new protocol lines being added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web@@ page on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You will find more current information on the source resources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
system V In@@ it is rapidly developing to the standard for program start @-@ up during boot @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ forming . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks at first among / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you will need a script for any system service that you want to boot when you run the system or change to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial that is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot .
the kernel looks for the program in@@ it at different places and starts the first one it finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . be very careful when you have mess@@ ed up the in@@ it@@ tab .
but how does it start all the proper scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called up with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have a server running level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six Run@@ levels to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . thereby the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ Level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case you have to edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the surrounding entries , before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with tri@@ mming to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ter number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by typing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplify the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated without a message if their configuration files are not present or configured in@@ correctly .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ ning varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry to save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some maps are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual adjustments . other cards appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the pass password management will appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this cartridge appears only if there is space restriction ( quota ) activated and initi@@ alized for at least one integrated file system ( identi@@ fiable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be altered for each user , with the space limitations listed in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with space limitation using the array file system .
the Groups tab informs about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs is to be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to the standard operating system , add the default operating system , add , modify , modify operating systems , remove , change , and more .
