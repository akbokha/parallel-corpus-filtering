<seg id="1">Translate the module website in & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the list below.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations do not make important decisions, without verifying the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by you on the Babelfish page, where you can directly insert texts to translate.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions you can find in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions.... Open the map card and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the kde; addons package. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & Conqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & Conqueror; on Extras "crashes. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View Filter module (called folder filter) can be reached in the & Conqueror; menu bar with Tools View Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, choose Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentative, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects using the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of graphically representing nested hierarchies using a so-called Tree-Map. tree-maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportionally to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap presentation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle switched over view color mode can either be depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or mapping of any other file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the labeling within the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For treemaps representation algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always complied with. frames are drawn to indicate the nesting of entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the View menu item listing in the area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn to the surface of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the picture gallery in the & konqueror; menu under Extras' gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the picture gallery, a dialog opens that allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the title" "" "Title" "" "allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>

<seg id="32">To include subfolders with the check box, you can set the subfolder to which level the sub-folders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">If you want to copy the original pictures to the gallery, copy the original pictures to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings offers you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The Media Playback for the navigation pane can be found in & konqueror; View menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with the F9 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click the & Conqueror's navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, with which you can change browsing and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only to certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser id of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change the browser id in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the code in MSIE for pages that refuse to access browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digicam; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the gPhoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitization; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. edit capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitised; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export, and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and possibilities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitised; tries to make reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests.... This opens a dialogue with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitization; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digicam; if you are a regular user of & digicam; you can ask questions to other users of & digicam; you can ask questions to other users here soon. however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get started & digitised is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digitised; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data file is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicam; you will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, which contains images, as the base folder. & digicam; looks at any subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitised; searches recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders, unless it is hidden in hidden folder. this can be done without adding a point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist have no photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can set up & edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keyword List to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can be digitised, possibly bypassing it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help raw camera support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digicam; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the gPhoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the computer, the camera is often used as a disk drive. the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the gPhoto2 program for digital camera communication, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgPhoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails. if the Exit support is not available in libgPT2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digicame; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitised;, to provide KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digitised; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came to & digitised;</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or change in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping images works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbaum, above the horizontal partition line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to select the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view at the moment. thus, filtering on the filename only works if this ind symbol view is also displayed. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored on the hard drive are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the disk, or after the date the album was created first. the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have a scanner set up, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import pictures to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select Edit properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can group together under a common name. the collection you choose will be used to sort your photos by selecting collection from the toolbar or sorting albums After Collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collection settings.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & digicam; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected. this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you then want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview panel. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My key word list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. to the collection are always all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each picture is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you must wait for a while, while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided where you can regenerate all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview. what information is available, you can change the settings. select the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows, which appear when you leave the mouse cursor over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the features of a photo. the screen shot in the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about digitisation; goes. albums and keywords allow you to organize your images as it fits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to these. you can reach all the features that are digitised; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by using either F4 Image Edit... or selecting the picture context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... Select a guide to edit your photos. image editing lets you view and modify your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digitised; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu. to do this, and how to adapt it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing through other image processing programs, problems can come with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store those data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest option is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate. in the sub-menu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview button and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you will retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digitized, it will be moved in the trash bin from & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Del If you'd rather want to delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My date limit & quot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digicam; uses either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">When you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Key words can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list; to fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The key words are saved in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the key words are re-imported as soon as & digitised; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this will become the forsword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a spot by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Edit keywords in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select as the album title in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My sample & quot; drag and drop there. alternatively, you can also right click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords to him. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a picture with keywords, this will be displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click on the photo's context menu and select from the Removing Menu. the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a temporal histogram of the number of images per time unit. a select frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box, a small lamp is the green when the search finds hits. if you click here, the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search did not find anything then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you will get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search that will always filter what you have entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the head OK and the search is done. the results will be used in My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, just select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the search form will appear again with the search information entered previously. if you select to edit your search, the search dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select delete in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digicam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database. an option can be added to this list with search group / keyword search group. any option can be associated with others via the logical operations All..., A..., No... or at least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicam; characterizes each image by a long figure with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one. by means of a swellert, the results selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-made color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the matching images. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it down. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this, of course, assumes your images contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the illuminated table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the beacon and its window will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you are using a preview of the toolbar and execute Zoo or sliding operations on one of the pictures, then these are also done with the other image.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to show it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal deletions also work directly from the lighting console, such as the F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it possible for example to simply link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see on the cross arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; then both images will show the same image area in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just as in other views. simply use the zoom control below the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures if you are previewed in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital asset management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management looks at any part of the process of following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. anyone who takes photos, scans or stores digital photos introduces a form of digital asset management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and re-use photos. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digicam; use. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, grouping, backup, evaluate, secrecise, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management adopts, indexes, categorizes, secures, seeks, transforms, confuses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no longer to find a particular photo without stock management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digicam;. the approach to store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you do enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that metadata is stored in & digitised in the metadata settings page; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so & digicam; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign each picture keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value. this makes sense, because you can concentrate on the best photos when working.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's start with key words, keywords, as you frequently are called by other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicam; automatically set up the tree for you or pasting the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The diagram shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of keywords - the next section refers to lettering or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from a distance there is not even a beautiful panoramic view of the beach. if you look at it closer, then you begin to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">Wow! you start to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with an inscription for yourself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text as you want in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your images in web galleries, then these captions are exported to the lettering and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the move of the spatial presentation is now moving with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of geolocation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographical indications. & digicam; can also export kml files that you can export with GoogleEarth.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digitised; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, for example to protect the identity of the photographer, it should not be changed. this field does not support either commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title: associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's job title. examples of this can be title like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is responsible for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here that offers the image to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in working with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image. for private persons this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique per picture. digicam; in the near future it will provide such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk defects, plate loss, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, desasterprevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, disseminated superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled prudently and you may no longer be trusted as a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording equipment and store them in the right way. the best DVD Riders are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable. so it is about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if they have just been written. therefore, they use a control summary mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control environments. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that apparently works wonders on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged floppies, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual player Blu-ray disc can store 50GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the data again to check you. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's guarantee covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available on this topic: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Some of SMART's errors are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors fixed by SMART cancel the imminent breakup. these are especially reading errors and displacement meters. the expected lifetime amount is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances do not make up a lot of electricity, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected too. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection devices that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for coaxial cables of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can cause the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow them to continue working until the current runs again. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 cost, One 500W UPS you can get for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are at home in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. additionally, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of flickr dramatically more.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the large companies a backup and a distributed storage are included in the offer. thus, they are desktop-proof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these errors remain undiscovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. it is rather worrying that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate intersections within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates dealing with disk failures on a low level and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a license for GPL. we can only hope it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% in desktop systems. notebooks account for 50% of thefts.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage than theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; nobody has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the widest file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling filesystems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden disruption during operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while technology develops further, there is a natural barrier to this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is deteriorated. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk you get today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone else responsible for data loss. thus, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before making anything dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash hit you'll be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget plane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, there is a common reason for loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two points of time: one of the total assurance and the last difference protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup is made. this backup comes with an versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of the files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file IPTC data, associated XMP files, original memory, storage, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while the time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered on the basis of explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted reside / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the drive if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier every year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard the GIF should replace. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to standardise the camera image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block & quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP matches that since it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, there can be problems when linking to the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread adoption of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a more sophisticated processing, you can use external programs. if you are editing & editing the images again, you should add the metadata again, which may be cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiBO.In the addition of a photo to an album you will be able to add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & digicam your digital camera; connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. for some cameras this may take a while. if the connection is made, a ferrite indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the association are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exit, Manufacturer, GPS, etc. this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of & digicam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All. this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in & digicam;. while downloading the photos are not deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download Selected Selected. the button Selected will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, there is a new download option available. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digicame; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download or download the selection buttons, a dialog with which you can select the destination album will appear in which the photos are filed. the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums. then select the Destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digicam; downloads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the delete button. if you only want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete selected delete them.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera; the photos will not be moved to the trash bin from & kde; they are completely deleted. so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully removed from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually reused after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames in case you load photos from different shooting series into the same album. therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made in the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for data- based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the commit will open three other options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two apply the data on the author in the default auto Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exit information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, for example, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-%% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option Date & time. for more customizations, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase when downloading. or in uppercase letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicam; used for a photo is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you next time you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; can use all information about orientation of the camera at the point of time to perform an automatic turn during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, it can be edited and digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date at which the photo was taken, it can be used & digitised; this is used to automatically load sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case it stores & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download Button. then choose Upload. the File selection dialog box appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digitised; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder chooser for the camera will appear. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitised user who wants to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 contains many GPS data fields, such as the direction, saddle and map references. so the question is actually more like the data in these fields coming? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last about manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page, you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script working with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signatures of hailed co-ordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitised; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible. to access these settings, you need to select Settings from the Settings menu; selecting Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can change between them by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing. you set the default behavior of & digitised; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as is shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC data fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this may include names such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the photo offered. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image of others & quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digicode; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digicam; imported without going missing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image lettering as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitised; to indicate what file types & digicode, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by clicking the Refresh button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the optical from & digicam; can be set on this page to the default values. each time you then open the illuminated table these settings are turned on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed images. if you prefer another color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode with F10 and F11 can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option, you can use the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, since the Deflate algorithm is low-loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">Even if you select the lossy resolution, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digicode, image editing was only one image viewer for photos. currently, it is quickly evolving into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option distinguishes the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the peak lights in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as a continuous white. use the setting colors resolve some unusual results, because it shows the top lights in various rose tones.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not so fast saturating as green and red. & digicam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digicam; image processing. to keep the time for the demo invoicing, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenesis Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue proofread values here. this is certainly the best method for a color gradient correction, since it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned. there are also LCMS and & digicam; information such as color information from one colour space to the other are to be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you're using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, that do not contain color-mapping or gamemcorrection. currently, dcraw gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile which allows you to emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated. this could be manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewers and image processing. by deploying this interface I can & digicam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and these will then be downloaded from & digicam; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">"" "shortcuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the" "" "Quick Command" "" "menu in the Settings menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the image transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes switch the metadata and / or, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand have a list of all supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try to see if & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the View menu of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving images into the trash bin, you can set the conversation from & digicam; by deleting a photo in an album. in the blanking of a photo and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right sidebar can be used silently by & digicam; applied when you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any feedback. otherwise, you need to apply the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen display from & digicam; under certain circumstances it accelerates the start process of & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start to search for new photos is forcing & digitization to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digicam; if something is deleted from the base folder, ask & digicam; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be set in & digitised, to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar in Settings Design. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicode, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitised; includes fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on thumbnail preview and selecting the Ad / Edit settings.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitized; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current filename, enlarging factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo, before you have used the Save or button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with Save as File.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Restore or the button Restore the image processing restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Restore and Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z for the return and note the Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; over the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image upload, image or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the check menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">Full screen view displays the photo in full screen mode. you will get to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you don't want this, you can change this in the Settings dialog from & digicam; you can view it from the editing window; view this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File Image menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or whole phrases. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Detection from the menu. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, without the navigation buttons, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab will allow the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or paste inscriptions with unlimited size. note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible, which means that all special characters are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After commenting, use either the Apply or just switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button More. this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcode Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field of Regency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used in this & digitised; session used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword fast. this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all words of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword exists already, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set to no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword has been selected from the right keyword tree to the selection and discarded. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off in settings Varied.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it needs to be one or its, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why are Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have adapted it mainly to & digitization; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colour-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner to have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a colour-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everyone would like to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. additionally, you should provide you with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (more information is available below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are via e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why use another color space and think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor when I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor since sRGB is emitting from sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you either need to adjust your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, before attempting any further manual editing, use it.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Adjustment and Contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminous thickness over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot are as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes, the same results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the maximum range and a new adjustment of all values in-between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a little limited because there is a colour space with 8-bit per colour. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in the blanking mode, which operates in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram shows that it will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you enhance or dimming the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the colour chosen to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values will also be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance to the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is available for the PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to consult the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to also save your settings so that you can always use the same error and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The colour effects include four colour effects, a solar simulation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when a partial pressure generated a short flashing light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% of intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment eventually creates a negative picture that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar simulation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the intensity of applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a converted color film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediterrot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the colour contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can start to experiment the different colors of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse issue: a too great saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">The tool tone correction is located between the complex mould Gradation and the Simple Leukthickness / Contrast / Gamma. even if the dialogue with this tool appears very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here. concrete the three slide below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selected range. below graph, three slides are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and watch out how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and thumbnail preview can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic y-axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammages.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones automatically. additionally, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Outputs: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, compression of the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reloaded later, using the Gimp level format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, media and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you just get the effect displayed in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is the most useful. in this case, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a ventral arrow to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On previewing the original photos, a red marker is visible. if you want to change this mark to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes -buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set using the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digitised canal blender; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison to one's own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">A red marker has a red marker to preview the target image. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminanz, the image will retain the general brightness as well when you change the corresponding color components. this is particularly convenient if you also use the option monochrome, as the channel blender then is THE tool to create great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the eyebrow. colourless consists of small noise files that don't appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns are different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you just get the effect displayed in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminanz is preserved. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can be easily converted on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, in all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this enhances landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokine (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and the redevelopment in an Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 ccoin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digicam; apply tools texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Added & digitised; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the confines of a photo is not an easy task. one way of keeping his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the distracting eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. throughout, the picture is stranded with a colored line, Niepce encircles it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), decanted it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a knocker effect and decoratively adds an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any place. this can also be done in multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from color space and character set with its properties as you need it. the larger the image, the greater the character set must be. finally, select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digicam; apply mould stencil you can lay a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Picture Template menu apply in image processing can be used to place templates across a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. you must, however, take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the template, simply send an email to the & digicam; mailinglist digicam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the templates files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it sharpens no little, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without a focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process must be combined with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. SLR cameras usually need more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness while reading the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening keystroke. you can use the menu entry to make more rigid.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, since the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but strengthens also the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will gain further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Concrete plasticisers and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount increase the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference with it applied to an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from the sharpness and therefore flaw defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image (2). fuzzy masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swellum = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicode; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blur mask. refocus normally reaches better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing more colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folds work much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which leads to this the mathematical result also depends on the source pixelae, which are far from original source pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focus: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value 1 should yield good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very blurred, but then pay attention to icons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use this parameter when your blurred Gauß is sch. this is most often caused by a previously executed innocuous filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you have selected large values for circular focus or gauze sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations that are not immediately visible are performing but will later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Wiener Filter, it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness regulator sets the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupillary.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinting allows a suitable colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools for removing unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as starting points to make the restoration easier. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to smooth smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film or CCD rouge a high value can produce undulating patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the level of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is going to run. normally, 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Load make this exactly. correcting any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact in the background that was caused by a bad film deposit during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireamt; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high sensitivity of ISO. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller flaws are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the gap between the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the filter's frequency response. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise points can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light density: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges, which are typically stronger. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitting damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may occur at the edges. it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is luckily much easier than to sharpen an image. use this tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Conducting softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film particles, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that emerge in digital, original or retroactively digitized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG data artifacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artifacts; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load make this exactly. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700R camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old colour photograph that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; Light Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-screen subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically reload it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image section and the preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a one-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels with a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shade) it the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also display this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use a center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unwiped effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's films and the color and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the Vignetting Correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the dot of the largest density of the filter. the default density is 2,0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or random a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image using the gnetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more fine adjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a light and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a proprietary algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grade handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect, flatter but at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient 4th grade corrects the distant vertices to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the distortion of the second degree. negative values can be corrected to correct tonar distortion and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the magnitude of distortion. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the reverse character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus performs a correction of the first degree. increase negative values while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion effect. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next startup.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tone or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before any changes or resizing. best perform this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tonal correction, the effect would be apparent to the false.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to show the dotted lines. move it to an important location such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it with the blanking tool in the menu Transformating cropping from image processing or over the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective in such a way that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-like correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film from the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 iinfrarerotic movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film grading and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film, the ISO regulator changes the amount of film particles and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; Filming Filter is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film particles on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix big silver particles of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; Filter Gravure shapes your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a proprietary algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicam; Filter Gravure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in images with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, daring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows setting the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the modified image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses proprietary algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses proprietary algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpen: blurgs the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a focal point. this simulates the blurring a zoomising camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels by a focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurgs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurredness: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linearly moving, z: B: photographed from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft markings: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking blurring: blurgs the image through random shifting of the pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent sharpen: finds the paint tank in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool for making raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one by Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digicam; image processing a area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the modified image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it to the right orientation by mirrors or turning. the tools for this can be found in the Transforming Turning or Transforming mirrors menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a picture with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes here a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformers size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image manipulation programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarge Every insert for photo can be saved as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse simply the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then move while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photo will be cut out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save files in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and width is assigned to the width of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the edit tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cooperation help make it possible to hide help so that you can put together your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-thirds, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Centre: the golden center is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you to your goal good results for your photos. compared to the third-party gel, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The gold triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal-angled triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles to break down your frame, you create an effect called by professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divides.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can become invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can repair this with the digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the preset button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the picture, you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function transforming cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically cropping function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option flips the image a bit after the turn. note, however, the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivist transformations are performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. preview will then automatically be recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the upper left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed domain.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed domain.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the lower left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed domain.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed domain.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes a bit smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shift, for example, will shift the top part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left.</seg>
<seg id="679">You can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line will appear. move the mouse to an important point, such as the sea, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets blurred. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two engravings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot, the picture has ugly triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicode.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="701">All picture editing tools such as sharpening, soft sign, noise suppression, refocus, masking, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applicable; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image. left of it allows five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphviz; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graph. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviz; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & Conqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph is recomputed and displayed in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphviewer; in a & kate; component.</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of the graphs is required. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar will only open the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>

<seg id="739">When you open a graphite file outside a running & kgraphviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can reopen all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice and change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the graph is to be distributed across multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page will be adjusted to this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a page distributed on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewed Download page gives the ability to define the behavior when a file has been modified on the disk, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (reload automatically or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page Open gives the ability to specify the behavior of & kgraphviewer; specify when a graph is opened out of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>

<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentication. so it's your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successfully logging in, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module is exported to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access rights that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press on the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data are stored in the EXIF words of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS trace as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical location correlative. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to run a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file, of course, contains data that were taken at the same locations in the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation lies below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpoleren and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is in a big difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the correlated button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. because the dialog takes the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed card. select this region and enlarge sie.Include this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to mount the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below will display the Albenign preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image gets a separate page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your related images. for this, select a folder where you have read permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that will be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the Programming messages to determine if errors occurred during creation. the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as twisting, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short beading and mapping. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual losses in quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases since no compression of color information is held. for example, this can be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">If you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the metadata module Import function, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This feature does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please look out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder Module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected will be included in the portfolio image files. there you can also change the contents of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is fixed below. a low value creates a very sudden, high contrast very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your needs, you can start the production of the movie with the code encoding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go quickly or calmly to enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show once you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print out directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats: JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images or otherwise use it elsewhere you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Exit information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert multiple images at once. therefore, if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to automatically override existing file. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the orientation of the image. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo apiece. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you preselected. you can add additional images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can use the OK button to open the New message window of your e-mail client. you only have to add the addresses and subject to the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at a time. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of the emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, add the comments to the images in a text file and add the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is completed, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced slide show, a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation activates very elegant visual transitions via OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option shows that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the loop" "" "loop" "" "ensures that the presentation will be shown in a loop loop. you can then manually abort with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The images chosen randomly make sure that the images are displayed in random order, so it's not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. by chance, every transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left corner of the screen. move the mouse in this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower left side of the screen you can see the current file name, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date currently does not have any documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop interface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the picture, entries are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both people are displayed are displayed. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which is of course also valid for locations, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the name, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image-click-window (described in more detail) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here you can see pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather like to try new features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog select the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry Photoalbum; demo. thereupon, some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you will find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name implies, this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed posts preview page from the database (if you select a date, the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview list) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only display images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is included in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you have to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and goal. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose if a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page. you can find more information on export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last but not least, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer even without a description. for example, that all images are of a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page, you can set up different resolutions for the images. as a result, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 should not download images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. it can therefore search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get a larger image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and then automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible for viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will start. otherwise, the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them there. thus, the import function, see, correctly works you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs. in them, a subfolder will be created, whose name will be set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you may want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to apply the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & photo album; this work will not even make it happen again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can share all images and share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in twofold ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy manually to the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically move to the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import file... choose, & photoalbum; import the exported database as described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Importing Wizard consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is called people. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you see images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the different steps of (1) determining the information about your pictures, about (2) the browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptation options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. many places in this manual are talking about images, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup to a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder where your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another folder with pictures, you can start & photoalbum; with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings box photoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will be given the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that enable you to view the preview and options for the viewer. a detailed help is available for each setting, which you can access the F1 button by pressing a button and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described in detail how to define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">View the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select an annotation and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog, you can set up full member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group are set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as stated in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digicam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the Module Module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & cophotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this on your own pictures The & kphotoalbum; demo database can be accessed either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not working. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications order their images in albums: in doing so, an album is simply a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & cophotoalbum; the current album that simply fits the current view, i.e. all images showing you the image preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here we go and photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have created in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category of persons, so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and choose the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you have a photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you see at the top a menu and a toolbar. below the toolbar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted in the image, where the picture was taken etc. you can put any image at the same time individually or for a larger number of images. if for example on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were taken.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them when you enter information on your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, through that the names used are moved up, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to view an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting icon by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and annotate these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the picture above and back-buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have included multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window showing the US as a group. to indicate that it is a group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Combat dialog's context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop there to categorize it to a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a box by dragging it outside the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are happy with the settings, click on the Options..., which offers, among other things, the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. you can see this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have no filter. an example of this is shown here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this will be displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit menu from the Edit menu. now the window will show you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can also use with & photo album; namely images, without you being stored on the hard disk. of course you need to have the images stored somewhere to record & photo album; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk. this is for example shown in the images 1-9. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that you can preview these images. however, you can also not view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back. so if you want to avoid trouble, like the messing up of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible for others and click on the Current View menu in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have set which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures to be hidden, thereby removing all the images you have locked.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be typed to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select a password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this image protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images can be found on the hard disk, and on the other hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml may delete the password as unencrypted text or delete it. this kind of password protection serves only to deny the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is in the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the top part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them and back by using the picture up and down the buttons. you can jump to the first and last picture with pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus respectively minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can drag and zoom into the image. to zoom in, you can drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button, you can zoom out The plus button zooms in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the zooms result.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the Stop button, you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the key key, zoom in so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zooming operations that work with videos are that you are in and out with the plus and minus button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can rotate the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you view images it can happen that you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter those names. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you view one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available to you in the browser. so, if you have all the images you are editing, printing or whatever you have chosen, you simply put all the pictures at one time. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you display categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you allow & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted one later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to close the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; on the picture, select from the context menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation on & Povray; you should necessarily read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wiremodal views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert Menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will appear, so that you can select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error message. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to renderate a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and there will be a small cross in the wiremodel view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a Wire Model. you can set this value relative to the level of view of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the visible stage of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple windows directives and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, pull the window to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the setter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, pull the setter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the map in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchorage, pull the passer on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left pointing arrow in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer bar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with the view pane... save it. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select View Render Modi in the View menu, then the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that allows you to recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the picture, select the section below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality drop down selector, you can select the properties that & Povray; used to render. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because the super-sampling refers to the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is split again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Fields of activity: abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further followed and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to create noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene select the menu entry File Importing... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet complete command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRAwBegin and / / * PMRAwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the object's source code into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. enter the path to your document retention and version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example high-level data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you also need to add the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window-type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick the high level of detail for extended projections, all the wiremodel views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you want to display wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you mark the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you want to activate channel smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more details about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing windows or create new window classifications. in the window classifications section it is explained how you can create and save window classifications.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector standard window arrangement: shows all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Existing window classifications list shows all existing window classifications. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window-arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created by the Add button and deleting selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with cartridge you will get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without a more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the Edit menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1085">This is the view of the scene from the camera's point of view. this shows you the results of the scene rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic camera settings, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points that allow you to change the target point of the camera. simply click on a checkpoint with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you click the Apply or the Enter button, the wiremodel views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, you see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example you could insert a rectangle (insert Endlicher body Quader) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then click the Apply or the Enter button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel view now shows the level, even if at the moment only as a limited final level. if you render the scene, the level expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shifting.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the soil to the exercise one unit below the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please choose first sub-object. the pigment will then change in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor-pigment), with a click on the thumbnail you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the disk and the ball in the preview, just click the Apply button and then get the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the checkerboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step as you have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (Don't forget to press the Enter button or the Apply button), the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matt black material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the sphere, you can now assign a material to it. as already at the bottom, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in sphere pigments. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection settings already give some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even when Metallish: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are available to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to produce a two-dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracer a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera; the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a source of light you also don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Restore.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, key shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add new commands for & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove toolsymbols for & kpovmodeler with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking on the & LMBn; or the Return button.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set each image to be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first characters of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc;</seg>

<seg id="1181">& amarok; uses like all other keyboard shortcuts. below you will find a list of these shortcuts and their function. the global key shortcuts can be set up by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the Global Keyboard Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may want to set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as & amarok; short commands work. thus, you make your keyboard to & amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlist browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function break might look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kdialog, so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError _ 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should assist each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes a new piece to be picked up. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, ask for more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustommenuClicked: submenu itemticked paths Includes the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to remove an entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemtite).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; end, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleanup operations, such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amarokscript. for this reason, you should appoint your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permission:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is complete, you can append it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus. maybe you just search for a particular title from thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date piece visibly to keep the playlist window open / unrolling to keep the running piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing part changes to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & amarok; s Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of various fonts in & amarok; by selecting Custom Scripts, the otherwise gray outlined section is activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom color scheme, you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selector, which is activated, for foreground and background color.</seg>

<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi-screen environment the OSD is supposed to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Karteimap audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers still activate further adjustments in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The KarteiLibrary collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the database type for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder which is & amarok; search for music files. to include a folder into the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively search subfolders: this causes & amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enable & amarok; to monitor the selected folder to changes (for example, if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>

<seg id="1241">Call similar performers: after activating this setting, & amarok; a list with similar performers can be called to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of functions and gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager controls the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but Fluxbox will provide difficulties for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by checking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. the support for this in & amarok; is a little more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries are compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens in case of a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not use it as a Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0]; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print" Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ "unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemtray9setPixmapERK7Q.Pixmap, then check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most of the installation problems are easily resolved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please enter only one error if you have something about fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; appears just a blank playlist. how do you get into music there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To make the GUI intuitive, the Start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist. click the title bar of the playlist and select column show rating. click anywhere in the new evaluation column to set the rating for a piece. you can also use the shortcut Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa heatsink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and output audio at the same time. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different ink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">It does & amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just listen to a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. enable sound & multimedia sound system settings. enable sound servers with the highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed reproduction. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA installation file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you don't use the Arts Driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes and crashes. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components. run the follow-up register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - Download the mpeg file, compile and install it. then run the Folder register, once as a system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with the mpeg-config / GStreamer-config) and run the follow-register.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current running piece or current stream. just below it is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can change by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also located under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control, and the play position slider. use the slider to set the play position or the volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playing and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classical to techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use the Equalizer Tools from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of features deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation area. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you might notice that the subwindow starts off. the information displayed there are now divided into other parts of & amarok; also, the information can be collected in the statistics window (extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the album cover picture and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its valuation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display covers images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer. this section shows the five most evaluated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, artist's albums, lists all the albums of the current performer that you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right click on it and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts written from other web pages using self-written scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try and amarok; if there is no text script running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version is then stored in & amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required for this.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Group interprets - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Group Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below will be a further division after the respective album. if you want to see conversions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list of different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted to Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically with each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - Your tunes will be sorted by genre and by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The last button lets you change the collection settings. note: & amarok; will automatically revise your collection once you change something to the selected folder. if you own a lot of pieces this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter right under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection field with which you can filter out the most recent additions to your collection. you can select different time windows, ranging from the last 24 hours to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empower the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry, you can reach the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player. for more details, refer to the Media Player browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n)... - Works the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Note the compilation mark - Change a compilation of marked album back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed by Various performers but again under the associated performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser is easy to handle with many playlists. among other things, it also includes Intelligent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent Playlists are possible. click Add Intelligent Playlists to open the dialog to create a new Intelligent Playlist. there, you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the artist's list. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, exit & amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list, all files that do not match your search criteria are hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the bottom part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick up music from an entered URL. for example, if you type tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press input key, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces attached to play. you can change the order by simply drag and drop the entries. once you enter letters, only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms by whitespace, you will find & amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all the entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all the pieces that contain one or two or three are found (or combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not according to entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: - Something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this looks for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key and then right click in the desired order to click the entries. the entries then receive a labeling with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar tool bar is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left side you can add the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, follow the undo and restore buttons. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks, and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, provided a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrower range, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, the key signature can be adapted further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup assistant. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this you need to enter your system administrator privileges, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for customizing and adjusting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled e.g. via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the dcop & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to use the dcop command line, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void jecref createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void / void burndvdImage () void burndvdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project received via the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void paddUrl (QString Path) void renameItem (QString Path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring NewName) void setuid (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / truank / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoders that encode these wav files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default.</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed in the MP3 or OGG format, or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it needs to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders have to be installed. all these programs are usually present for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the CD; it is not possible to read a protected audio CD; read out. in any case, & kaudiocreator; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying Copy-protected audio CDs; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up has to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration), then the daily use to read a & CD is explained; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stumble over at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. step by step example, you can find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB request of CD data starts according to the set up of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - when an encoder is configured in the code Settings tab in the Settings dialog - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. note that previously the Encoder was configured in the Settings dialog in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already-read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as logs, beeps) for program events (like reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences become less important as both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still included with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex tracks of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is overdone for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or downloaded by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of application settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; can be added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read and enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it should be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note by the translator) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the CD; information published on the & CD; and in addition, the information without the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address as the used in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used for the use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror-server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the codec and therefore the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information about Kodiver can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read reviews on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio processors of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy protected audio CD; you want to read it out. check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You have to install cdparanoia and lame on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, since it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission (eg, by trying to copy something into the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set up of & kaudiocreator; something that is supposed to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what for each end-to-end & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the audio format used for compression of the music (lame) as well as audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program that freedb to use around the CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reader program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device designations for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / entered as shown in the screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just ask for incomplete information, so you will be notified when information on generating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD to download data automatically via the Internet from a freedb host.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; record found, immediately begins reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand. however, to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for downloading & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how do the system know which data to get the CD? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but since many firewalls buck the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 80 protocol since the protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want & CD; submit data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Discard CD; after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; to discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom Folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not crossed, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is somewhat long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described how the process of reading the CD is running on the hard disk. we will create a connection to the Internet as we are comfortable and want to pick up the CD; data from the freedb. the process described in this section must be repeated for each end-end & CD; repeat.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from that for a & CD; with successfully from freedb fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually to enter instead of retrieving them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then go to the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; gives, a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD; matches.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Type the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered into the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply jointly for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after successfully retrieving data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot below. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also regenerate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the editor's help to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the end-to-end CD. in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD data anyway. for more information go to freedb.org's website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the Title Data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and album will be displayed on the BOM list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are so marked will be read out. a simple click on the line toggles the selection of the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the button All the pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at a time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process is started by clicking the button selection, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a coaster you haven't yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder aren't what we entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format. thus, read out and coding in parallel. notice the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with performance-weak machines the result is unclear. the used machine with an AMD64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding (of though two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order placed in the queue of the coaster. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; is currently being entertained within the kde; CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package. however, most distributions already include a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; part of an important & kde; package. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variations of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version of a manual for & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it. at least only after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you do not need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player from & kde; beside others, it also has some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have with real-time graphics and karaoke experience.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound Project Driver needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a Sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of any MIDI channel activity by highlighting the pressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you exit & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; windows drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the play menu, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically when you drag it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played back one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid plays a piece, you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and running with the slider back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows to the left and to the right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, press the space bar like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu entry break in the play section, interrupts playback. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and other both. some pieces have no lyrics: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined that uses a song, so you don't have to manually set it manually. so, if you want to enable automatic text selection in the Settings menu, it will automatically change the karaoke text. you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">In case you want to set an event type, select the entries of text events and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. these are played after the series. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu Collection under the point Organized... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the each one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not stored. remember when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song to the Add button. it will appear in the file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence according to the collection sequence from the main menu, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the next song from the menu, or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song backwards, select the button Prey piece, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and will always sound a trumpet if a piano was originally intended to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM modes and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define Keymap "A more Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI will be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term "drum patch" refers to the patch in which each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the rows is very important as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to map the sounds on the percussions-channel. see for example the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do that in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be defined with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all the events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">If a MIDI file sends a pitch bender event with the value n, it will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed it. the value 4096 is used so that the map file doesn't have decimal commas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM anticipates that a keyboard that gets a pitch bender event will play with the value 4096, a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave above. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a number of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you will see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and to the right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid, compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag it to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before that, enable Automatically Adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I want to play a MIDI file) or want to play a file, simply switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off Automatic Adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you only want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically Adding to the collection and open A.D.. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this animates me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, MIDI files, making music and proving propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me feel great if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list them (if you want to). before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & mid; completely written in my free time and won't give money to anyone for it. I would like to emphasize that I only programmed myself because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the CIS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westlder, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or just a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on his homepage, which is found under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search information and view images. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends substantially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you have to compile it with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD's or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. when you click on an entry, its group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and the reproduction starts with the selected entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and persistent playlists can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. simply click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and select the next edit mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose the playlist by playlist and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Animation while staring and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / .xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation while starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically ended by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the ad of one favorite picture: & lt; & lt; img dur = "in." src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet"; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif."</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the KMPlayer toolbar. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, such as setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a flash is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog will be specified by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the Browser module library. if there are no errors here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">For example, this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there, ports should be detected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb inside.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also possible only on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must include the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introversion, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any way I can quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is run as user root after the device is inserted. it is essential to make sure that / dev / cdrom is pointing to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is outdated. kxineplayer automatically takes the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a brief description of the functions and more information about this are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - as well as other source text editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & Kile; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is most likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it is saved through the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & kile; automatically generates a blank line (for typing the text) and the corresponding line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in the Settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful for back-up. once a DVI-file (D e V ice I nr file) is created, skip & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output format of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are added to the editor, and as soon as an element is clicked in the DVI; file, the corresponding section is jumped to the corresponding section in & latex; source code is clicked to the appropriate place in the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other included .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the & latex; source code will be compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is on an all-in-device, all-in-all, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick build.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large boxes should be found. the selection fields have been developed for the rapid classification of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick link of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box for further information is available for items such as keywords, notes notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Description: with this command a name for a section, a picture or other element will be created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choice above a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ m e is used for defining the font. it is possible to specify the fonts for the main text, marks, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the building or the push button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically saves storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If compilation of the document fails, it should be sought in logging after the errors. when using high-speed build & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, also the logging should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. if, for example, a report with the font e 12 is created, and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow you to change the font in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, bold prints, italics, submissions, etc. these commands end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics and is long enough until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be italics with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; markup language, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile will follow.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better legibility of the document. for this purpose, a quote, a few places in bold and italics and a poem may be applied to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file is created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format (D e V ice I nr). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as Printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document (see). at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is configured correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar opens the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; binary files. to do this, only Modern settings must be set up under Settings... Tools Construction will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the preview search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on the preview search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then executed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Ocepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document from & kile; opened and jumped to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Ocepiece; as text editor (configuring eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error, there may be errors. if there is an error, it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file tells the source of error in the source code. in the editor you can use the 'Previous LaTeX Errors' and Next LaTeX errors for leaps between the errors. the log file always lists the line in which the error appears. to view the flawed line, you must click on the error in logging and & kile; jump to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When choosing blank documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File Template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings General can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in a document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the custom template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate, as an internal editor. & kate. is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about posters; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be consulted with Kate. users of & Kile; can start reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be accessed over the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands used in & latex; and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed trl button to select the & tex; word. this means that in this way, when you click\\ par from\\ big.exe, only\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the various kinds of source texts and highlight them. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can insert additional jump marks. these are an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu items Edit Herbs or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. thereby, this jump mark is highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although there are already excellent possibilities, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code has always been added.</seg>
<seg id="1817">This extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive thing in & Kile is that the slots are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word from the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning as this command also displays & latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, it can be selected and removed by pressing the Delf button. & Posters; provides the keystroke Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands here for a faster option. under Edit Remove, the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to Edit Selected paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for more commands in editing environment for a more accessible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lieject the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or inside the command\\ begin {surrounding}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command fulfills the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; offers also special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded closing clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor jumps before or behind the sharpened clamp of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested, welded groups parentheses, the overview can quickly be lost. this command fulfills the last group, so that the nested structure of the tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as a guide. for the purpose-purpose implementation is used in & kile; the sign "for two simple quotes." & kile; knows this case and for two key stop signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic single-click sign can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use foreign language specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French quotes. there are also many more languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift; input key for & kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">In a table environment complete t & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with an end-to-end line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added to Settings box... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. when using Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; according to the next tab in the underlying line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, it has been added to & Kile; to add special commands (usually for & latex;). three of these work on demand and the other two are for automatic complete destruction. all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings box... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} will become & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the back button is pressed, the last letter of the input will be removed, and it is possible to change the list. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from & kile; also jump marks can be added, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible with the Edit jump mark NÃ ¤chste jump mark and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Block; Complete can be made settings to these lists. you can select different registry lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as words of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the Call of Full Stop mode will result in a large e list with ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When executing full-time mode over the volume modifying environment or pressing Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically fired and it appears\\ begin {. thereafter, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will be closed automatically. once & again, recognize that this is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Block; Complete can be made settings to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ ter List of Destination Mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of derivations that are immediately replaced with longer strings. lists can be set up under Settings box... le Forms can be set up. as an example of a check list, the file is example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word is started in full-time mode over the volume of full-volume cooling or the key Ctrl + Alt spacebar, the letter L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large e walls are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been established that many of them are written more than once in a document.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Tables can be deactivated. here, the threshold value for displaying complete damage can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The corruption files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder. mode is available for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog box forms the entry of graphics as easy as possible. to view the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as familiar as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all the tools are compiled in groups in the Creating compile, creating change and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the second conversion can be used the key Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed by Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick build command, a viewer is usually called upon the compile. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be launched about the project New Project.... In this case the following information will be asked for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When filtering the filename window, the relative path of the .kilepr project file must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & Kile; allows execution of the ECMAscript code. scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed yet and can be modified in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= box) with the following methods:</seg>

<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & Texlive; are supplied with many documents, including documentation for the included packages and another & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not only a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the & latex; commands contain and thus is ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & kile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Because of the amount of documents with which & tetex; / lylive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help provides & tetex; / lylive; the small application texturtk containing a database with all documents and boxes; delivered documents and for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for package names or keywords. von & Kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we begin with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all the included plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. by adding plug-ins without a location & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose who he is from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold after which they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of one's own identity are important in terms of news and annotations. see for more information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Event configuration of the Shift; F7 project Settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note input is simple. it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword will be entered in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Note can be sent to a determinable member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the nickname of the recruited top name of the team member, is a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the parentheses and the characters are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, the DTD agnostic is supported and web-based formatting and scripting languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here are only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta... called. this dialog covers some pages that are dealt one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; with regard to tags including car completion can be modified.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal / lowercase means, the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags: when checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and end tag automatically: when enabled, the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using the Standard button, default specifications can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise open files (where the encoding of the file can be bypassed). this setting, however, is ejected from the same in the project properties when a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties when a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regularly backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to look at the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the default window settings back to the default in the next start is useful when the user interface is messed up by changing the MDI modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can define the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source text view in shared mode. see for the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the depiction of the parser node in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structure tree settings, the visibility of knots in the tree, the update frequency of the tree to edit and how deep can be opened automatically when changing the structure tree. empty knots are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting shortcuts (a kind of templates) that can be unfolded while editing. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the ifclause ingronym stands for something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plugins can be managed here. plug-ins are part-applications from third side, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the most well-known and konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard site like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "Read Only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. pick it possible even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been discontinued, as is the support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with time numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action will make the link to the debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging claims. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger so that normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session Starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the noise according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debugging is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next command in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next script in the script, where possible, if possible, in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were no current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale and this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can customize & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; can help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type edit packets (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic-oriented leftovers of image buttons (above the editing pane), the text and instructions are more quickly inserted into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how tagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. file descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carries the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus, is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name inside & quantaplus, is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a method name and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag may occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag that can be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a fracture, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog above is in & quantaplus; -windows to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available yet. currently, verification takes place only when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element of the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "option" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be reachable via DTD processing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = Verturn1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... created. clicking on New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut that has been assigned to this action. by clicking the user definition button a shortcut can be assigned; with one, the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) to be started. examples of & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / mysq.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myscript.sh.This way you will find: global script folder: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of running & quantaplus; if only one instance runs, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can input from & quantaplus, to the standard input. in the input field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the application can also be rerouted according to the input. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, directed to the standard output. it can be specified what is to be done with the output written to the standard output by setting the output selection box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in the given case it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. press the New Action Button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them, enable dialog" "" "Edit Tag" "" "when available so that an input is possible when using the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly icon. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphic other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels as standard, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit Size below.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regards to the day's start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this icon will be a & lt; startgt; tag in the current document will be added.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings set actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the application button and continue with other tags, if there are any ones, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the item that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview window. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by absorbing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your descriptionrc, so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened by the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language that you prefer. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docs file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentaries e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2html tag2 = tag3html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation is something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it out yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to form context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function will be shown. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the waste resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at various locations there is an email, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where everyone else & quantaplus; -user can download them. to make an individual contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, after your passphrase is asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New resource, you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menu, uploading tool bar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigated & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in XML format. there is a simpler way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that should appear in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adapted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring these concepts closer to them without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus, available. from toolbars about actions, everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific samples and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related items are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -Patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the project's folder tree, which allows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the carers with information and toolbars. please suggest, and for more detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tab, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Splits in the Editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse pointer, help to Word under the mouse cursor, or Open the File, if the string under the mouse pointer refers to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; PGT; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building manviews (QIT;) enable you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and roam. in the representation with carts are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building manviews.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be carried out with the context menu that appears.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, parts of the program, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here as well. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an item, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking an item, a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree view. with it manly can change attributes and namespaces. the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add project-specific documentation, edit and view.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tab at the bottom of the window to be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive about & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can save and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; -Files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a host of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now widely on the way to a universal and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus, for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim has to be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework it allows users and developers, & quantaplus, as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows Web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">To learn more in the details, help: / Quanta (either enter this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help helpshelp: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the Templates section. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from the clipboard there are special characters for & HTML; enrolling so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard in & URL; enrolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Turning and switching off the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks made from other open documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with file extension .webblaj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, are managed by the project. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project file / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this will only create the name. actions need to be set by setting actions... to be added. tool bars are stored on toolbars toolbars or you'll be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it doesn't delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team for the tool bar to be available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load A & DTD; that has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities of the & DTEP; replenish without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML,) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the tags / actions list on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag creation dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of toolbar is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugin menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on it. clicking on an activated plug-in will disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the current document's syntax based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or create unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the index card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode corresponding to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behaviour of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars or add them and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in line with the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webblaj (e.g. foo.webblaj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, one unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have a static web content that you want to download and change. if you have failed scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Leave if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clip from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow Profile or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignor, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about the project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles sub-window, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by attaching time to its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. this behaviour cannot be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the menu Project or the icon Project will open from the toolbar. the dialog Project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webblaj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus, the project file is automatically stored. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening... in the context menu with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and will be forgotten in the end of the program. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the disk store option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many highlighting profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialogue is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simply moving the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the tool toolbar tool toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of and quantaplus, to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are the best tool for customizing the toolbar menu. use and addition differ. adding tool bars is treated below in the Add tool bar section below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Toolbars and symbols can be adjusted either by means of context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created. other actions such as toolbars can be removed, tool bar rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be indicated in the dialog where it can be specified, which actions should be visible on these or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries remove action and display action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code escalopes and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus, in about the restrictions that one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; templates supplied have conditions for their use. please read the conditions outlined at the beginning of each template before using.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more specific documents are made in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples may be found in template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can contain everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-basis. some examples are found in template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole web sites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As a template, save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click in the file tree or in the project file tree view to a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and secure. by default it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented procedure. you can specify headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert or associate files with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps /</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set a folder's behavior in the template list, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden when parental attributes are inherited.</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor, where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor as well as in the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is active, this mode is already active, offset the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. depending on the choice of VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically the time interval can be set. basically, the recommendation: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so you can select the document properties. this allows the processing of invisible tags during work with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this can be changed:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the modification of the contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keywords Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is the same as in a word processor, due to moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the selection works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and by means of pushbutton or removal button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way across the toolbars, such as the source text editor. it must be noted that tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other armature tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the Sheets Wizard or the Listen Assistant are disabled, and will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made a lot of changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot more useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; with automatic selection of the correct changes. the merge editor under the differences window allows you to edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...), or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will notice your selection and will show it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By selecting a folder, you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, however, for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is crossed, the input field becomes active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to immediately set an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting with the compare / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor, and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would only need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while. then a small help window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column of the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is represented on fractional lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription form:, the filename and [gechanges] when you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merging or manual editing, there is no more line left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the queue is displayed. this is only a wildcard for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a mark you might copy and add somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring the numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate in one of the windows, you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, side up, side down, start, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Audition Window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigating the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-Image Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to clipboard, you need to press the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if it is enabled, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option, because you may overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line-ending of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when moving and restored at the next start. (menu Setup - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides scriptures with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When activating this option, differences in italic font are displayed. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered astray. on these systems, the preset button automatically displays an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, any selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual into the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, others only save a newline '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the carriage return character is made visible, but as a white character is treated. during merging this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is downlighted. in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is downlighted. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensely for even minor differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-forward mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before going on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">(default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then you better use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. see for details under documentation about the folder comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you have to & kdiff3; quit and reboot so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for coding a short reference appears, which is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing instructions, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off to suppress changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded rollover column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; & lt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second check column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just stop the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison windows next to each other or over one another. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge again, the name of the last file used will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user greater flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further preprocessing command for line comparison. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and any hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Replacement / ZIP 'However, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data visible by the newline algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparison and merging of individual files. you only have to specify the folder on the command line or in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, Folder 1 will be used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be notified of a small message box about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that date are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list box with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and folder found in the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">You can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or double-clicking on the object or by double clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories can fold and all subdirectories can open up or fold up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then, folders have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a file and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a file and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Synchronize mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option directories are synchronised. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsure) then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and if the files are different, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is executed one after the other. the Status column displays finished when merging has been successful, and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected happens. when merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the merge is alright.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (including all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder then in the Three-Folder merge mode C is used as the target, in the two-folder merge B is chosen as the target and A and / or B will be used as a target for synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (shortcut). to only merge the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. they can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box with the options appears, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you only want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), leave & kdiff3; you have the option of selecting another action for the entry or solving the problem in a different way before continuing to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merging has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. several patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than one pattern typed, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be more than one pattern typed, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignors.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems, a previous dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In case of links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links point. this is downlighted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated as normal folders and searched for recursively. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a final loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) Complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders using a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the changelation date and file size. however, this speed benefit will cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the trusted date of the change-date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are equal. for example, this may be useful when copying the change-date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the later file is proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is presumed that the other file has not been changed as well. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will also be deleted without a backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only the merge whole folder. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files; you can move the divider to the mouse with the mouse. if you don't want that, you can disable the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the folder & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is also a menu entry in the list menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do this, use the current file merging from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be restored and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol it uses. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (please note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is at present as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts with the built-in difference viewer. to start Kde3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In Kde3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needs & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - Kdiffusion Part. note that it doesn't work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot) are already available. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or how to go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is considered not to be identical. if simillines appear next to each other, this is done, but this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort therefore has been too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text, suddenly, no src has been removed; no src has been removed, and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiffusion on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3 sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Um & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compile. however, if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) Copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Paste) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show differences only: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also leads to the fact that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">If you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is downlighted. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, exit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has to set up the two entries pager... and exit. if however, click on an application within & Kpager, then the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and exit. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is indicated together with name, the names will be marked with folder numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty buttons are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the order of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically let & Kpager; in a 2xN grid appear, as is known from pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontally shows all virtual worktops in a horizontal and vertical line, which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with their contents and move. furthermore, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up the switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have a write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you have to enter the key windowtransparentMode and assign it to a value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package is kdebase, you will need a working install of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for various users: these include artists, web designers and people with a visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on high performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the picture shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is described below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer such as a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can create a selected screen area in the magnifying window (select window mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you press the & Shift key, press the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Cmag; possesses a lot of features. you can send the magnified image directly to the printer, save to a file, copy to the clipboard (to add it later to other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the display update. stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window appears. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Cmag; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files, opening a new window, printing, reloads (with the button document reload in & konqueror;), Enlarge and size reduction & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen magnifier; you can use an area of the screen as if you use a magnifying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired.</seg>
<seg id="2495">More detailed user documentation can be found with help: / Kmag (either enter this URL into the address bar of & konqueror; one or run the help center help: / Kmag).</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointer persists for a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic auxiliary equipment, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and clicks when you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, make & kmousetool; take a break after it emulates the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the move, before releasing the mouse button. this way, you can drag the dragging on with pressed mouse button. this way, the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after holding down the mouse button, the mouse button will wait before the mouse button is pressed again if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through the mouse-shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving leads to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at any start from & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to launch a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the user's last push.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart shift should be switched off at first. if you then have used to the automatic click, you can later move the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you wish to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick here is that you do not just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you should be able to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using intelligent shifting in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation no longer can end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click on your own. thus, the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in a different position.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor anywhere you want it. however, park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of mouse & eg can no longer cause the mouse clicks to be triggered causing unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to mark this way text, paste it into clipboard or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will likely only cause problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, mark the text by clicking at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this time, whenever & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when, when moving smart, the delay time begins. later, you can use the smart move even without the audible click of the mouse. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; be installed. that should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button once the mouse cursor is short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and who cause pain to the jaws of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a drag process before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2532">On the first side of the wizard (left screen shot), enter the command, which will be used later for the speech output of text. for more details, please refer to the description of the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the default text passage. from the text passages you can choose often used text passages without typing it. of course, the text passages can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you define the dictionary for word completion. & kbreak.reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words. additionally, you can compare the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary so that only correctly spelled words are included in the word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kbreak.is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screen shot) and a running memory of the already spoken phrases (the upper white field in the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you are mouth watering, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken phrase is attached to the expiration memory. you can select sentences which are to be spoken again.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech-dispatcher program. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent specific shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the speech-dispatcher program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the orders will resume.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News is the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page can be read, you can start with & kmouth; someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order you want from the postcard jobs is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for issuing longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues except for screen editing. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reading, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there may be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is delivered with pre-defined string substitute filters which enable the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or formatting messages from & conversational; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style language - Transforms) to convert XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in translation of & XHTML, in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters you can send jobs depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that has the text on & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the speaker card, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules after which it is used for a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning, or a & kde; alert is sent, it will be processed by all the activated filters installed on the bottom. the processing by the filters occurs in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will display the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for setting string replacement filters. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text. upper and lower case is not considered when comparing.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it must only be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Reset column. the list is processed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here for the text order. click the button to display a list of languages.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application-id running programs get you with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only type copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Diesen Filter box if they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be delimited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer translate & XML; using XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such formulations. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Selection filter, you can send texts to a particular speaker that is set up on the speaker card or a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that lyrics should be read by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>

<seg id="2658">The speech output API, from & kde;, can give programmers their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so that & ktts; this synthesizer can use.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -DBus; interface of the speech output API from & kde;. the complete documentation for both APIs is available on the kde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>
<seg id="2661">Applications require voice output services via the & dbus; interface from & kde; from the program kttsd to the object KSpeech.</seg>
<seg id="2662">The text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as & eg; en, de & etc;</seg>

<seg id="2665">None of the mentioned speech synthesizers support my speech. where can I get a synthesizer for my language?</seg>
<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; re-formerfilter, but if the module is used for festival websites, web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone so that Sable works at all. you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure the program xsltproc is installed and can be found about the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain signs or punctuation marks appear to cause mistakes in the synthesizer, so that whole sentences are skipped or only cowl welds are spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First, make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language. if there are problems with certain notes or words, they may be fixed by a string replacement filter. see.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with every speech synthesizer, which can be launched on the command line in a console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizers to the supported languages. also look at the ktts website;, for information that is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech-dispatcher program uses a customizable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you wish to expand & ktts; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including the kdelibs and development files for the speech-dispatcher program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source archive for kdecode, or downloaded the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts, first check whether speech-dispatcher is working properly with your speech synthesizer. to do so, you can use the spd-conf shell script.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program cttmsgr should be developed in such a way that speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can walk back, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text on & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, this will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add to Add on the Karate Map, and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the Karteimenu speaker unit will be displayed. as an example, the module for Interactive Festival Interactive will be shown below. details on the modules can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is contained in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text submitted to festival. for voices that are familiar to the festival, this setting is made automatically. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These slider lets you adjust the volume, voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some of the controls and display it in grey, the voice you selected does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn-voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window kttsmgr is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol kttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this checkbox is selected and kttsmgr is not running yet, it will appear in the system field as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence. the spokesperson ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row, you can set or return substitutes in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">By clicking OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) will be adopted and kttsmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to show the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aCode, click on the audio card audio. see also.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aCode is to be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speech speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds approximately half and 200ml;% approximately the double normal speech speed. in order for these adjustments to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the current & ktts; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are installed in your system. most of them will not work. you must find out which device works with you. in doubt, choose default.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktts; handles four types of speech orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after reading the output of the screen reader, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the highest priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kbreak.is an example of an application that speaks out messages. if you want to read a long text on a website, you can start with & kbreak.Still greet someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">When a text order is interrupted by a message, warning, or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings, and output of screen reavers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read KNotify messages, start kttsmgr and click Notifications. the card message will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to enable the reading of & kde; notifications. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is checked, notifications with which a sound is played are from & ktts; not read before.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & Conversation; sends whenever someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selector to set what & ktts; do when an event arrives. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected a custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want. standard selects the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the Karteimenu speaker as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The Event All notifications for the Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can set the default messages as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the notifications to a file. use the Download button to load stored settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except All notifications will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard includes brands for controlling voices, voice speed, volume, gender, voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of language abbreviations.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice used in the SSml issue.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100ml; ssh text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs can subdivide text into individual sentences. this way & ktts; faster with pre-reading, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; as default, a set limit detection filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add more set limit detection filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying out. turn on the speaker selection and select text to read. turn on the speaker selection, change some features and check how the speaker is selected. of course, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with pre-reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel orders on the card's card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Syntax check filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the punctuation limits (tabs are removed automatically from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit detection filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied on & kde; -messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit detection filter from default, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts;</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the speaker chooser menu, you can overwrite the speech settings for the application. the card will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the topmost on the card speaker). in other words, there will be no talk features defined.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all the characteristics of an appointed subscriber. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, choose & ktts; otherwise choose & ktts; the speaker, the most likely corresponding to the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">As the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may wish to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all features in the Speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker and then use the speaker which is most likely to match the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 for the last word order is in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; it was terminated. probably you need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is probably installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work when I play music with another application at the same time. when I hold a text order, freeze & ktts; one. on the & Console; appears a message stating: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent concurrent opening of multiple PCM devices. see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalue / vocals. as a guide you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. to make this work, the program must be sox installed and discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesize modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card for subscriber setup. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml reformerfilter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At the festival 1.95 beta the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce errors, the xsl file will reject the GENDER tags for converting SSml to Saber. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can go back or back in & ktts; I can no longer set or return on the tab. on the tab orders it is displayed, the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You must not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation point, comma and semicolon).</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules for GStreamer are registered by running the command-register before using GStreamer in & ktts; (HTTP: / / gaspamer.freedescaltop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system is also included, you can't play music at the same time and let it read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you pause a text order and start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aCode does not support any real pauses yet. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the talk speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox with the apt-get install sox command. the program is included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you & ktts; as tarball (with tar-packed archive) downloaded, register as normal user and unpack the tarball into a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them possess a runtime dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2768">Before using & ktts, first check whether your speech synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is generally good, and the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you can find help in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software into festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8 bit) code, such as koi8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; synthesizer. then takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generated from it the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the option Network Setting at the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when the module's network settings start, this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best corresponds to the distribution and release strip. by checking the setting no-again the definition can be made durably. then, the next start of network settings will be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, click the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the module's entire functionality is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">Tab Network Interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the device you want in the list and clicking on the interface... in the Dialogue device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are retrieved from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are performed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface on booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. ping an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the address you want is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be enabled or switched off as required. switching on an off-switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and deselect interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed, or changed. DNS entries can be placed in priority by selecting a entry and / or downgrading in the list with the buttons on or down in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... from the group host to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group host to the name resolution, select an entry and then click Edit... It will display dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list Namely known computers describes the host name-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used during booting when there is no DNS server available. in small, remote networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of Namely familiar hosts contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in test version of IP is supposed to replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add button. if the well known machine has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit... Edit the Find dialog box will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module's network settings are not effective immediately in the system. to enable the changes, you need to set the following command in a & Console:</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkstation; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient, but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkstation; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace any further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact point that fits a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be arbitrarily chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are mostly used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = one's own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you find the configuration files affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL links than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which furthermore provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it has to be mounted by & kdat. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat - disseminates the band back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the band. recognizes & codat; the pre-tensioning on the band is not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & codat, the pre-tensioning man, searches for the appropriate index on your record. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape is included. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by hatching the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the strap, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& codat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the band, that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat. this process requires that a tape must be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the band of & kdat. floppy disk drives usually require formatting the tape, DAT drives are not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, the tape continues; with the formatting of the tape. all the data on the tape is lost! after completion of the format process the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files listed in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens up settings for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Verify....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate recovery, the files that are to be recovered will need to be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Rightclick a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you confirm the settings for restoration, the dialog appears Restore. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band indexfile by means of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed in backup files, only the files located within the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be filed separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file systems.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & quot; & lt; & lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, the order is transmitted and validated; before the tape is mounted the command will load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try to lock the ejection during the tape drive. possibly this setting doesn't work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, it is automatically ejected when the tape is loaded. do not use this option for floppy spreaders.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat, change the hardware-bearing block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. regardless of whether this setting is active or not, you need to be able to communicate the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a storage block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this icon is only active when a tape is included.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; ist ein & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access, for example, to information about issues that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of specific programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the screenshot below, it provides functions for easy filtering and sorting of the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - is not shown, and it opens instead of its a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely do not have access to system administrator privileges. the protocol files normally do not have permission to read under Linux.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter to a selected criterion or string. to do so, enter a string in the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed, so that only the log lines are displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. in addition, select the name of a process in the protocol file system protocol, and then carry out & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol lines of level hint. the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned off the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to see all the new protocol lines being added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own webpage on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You will find more current information on the source resources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion repository: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init is rapidly developing to the standard for program start-up during boot-up of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reforming. the & Linux; kernel looks at first among / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you will need a script for any system service that you want to boot when you run the system or change to another runlevel. system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial that is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for the program init at different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. be very careful when you have messed up the inittab.</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the proper scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called up with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have a server running level running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six Runlevels to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. thereby the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new RunLevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorter number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case you have to edit the sorter numbers of the surrounding entries, before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with trimming to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorter number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by typing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplify the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply terminated without a message if their configuration files are not present or configured incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Running varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry to save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some maps are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual adjustments. other cards appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The pass password management will appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This cartridge appears only if there is space restriction (quota) activated and initialized for at least one integrated file system (identifiable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be altered for each user, with the space limitations listed in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with space limitation using the array file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group affiliation of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs is to be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to the standard operating system, add the default operating system, add, modify, modify operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
