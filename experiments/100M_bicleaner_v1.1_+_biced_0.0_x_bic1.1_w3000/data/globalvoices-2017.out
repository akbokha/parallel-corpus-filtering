although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country has such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the grand d@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter revealing the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free by Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only increased .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never thinks behind the mountain as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , received people from all over the world , a deeply faithful man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Tr@@ ump Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung didn &apos;t agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
d@@ umps In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos; commitment , which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump opened his way to the nom@@ ine@@ e Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters to be ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for dump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget David Rem@@ nick &apos;s words , which comment on the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ B . : so much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; pu@@ n play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whi@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , as the great Van Jones called , has exactly killed what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have always , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices grew lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , the news said .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love of music by tr@@ ash .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura have in common ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a big land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 pupils became the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the Municip@@ ality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is well known for its drug abuse and ban@@ ishing violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located virtually at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the leadership of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music from the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced by tr@@ ash .
today , there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material , called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates about 1 billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land fill harmony follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly inc@@ ens@@ ed and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this kind on their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to dock at one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : he did not succeed in catching fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project , En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . this makes illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the speed of slu@@ gs , with information circul@@ ating between individual countries , these actions happen in real time , with trace@@ ability to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspect activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas , such as those that suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and if they were a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports based on this information , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they may even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the above @-@ mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD from lost turnover that the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year lose because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world .
their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing protected species , and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you purpos@@ efully use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an incomplete control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must@@ n &apos;t attack my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 resear@@ ches of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for fighting crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious vessels more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly evolving helps to detect the illegal ships that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which is also concerned with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , so that they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine conservation organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each tracking ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has to run a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to face consequences are now aware that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats have more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so powerful that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined together to form the West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . . &quot; safety is the target of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag , was on the road . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they advance against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the topic of environment , technology and nutrition .
her articles are published in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on its release , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ dep@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ de@@ an regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continually deterior@@ ates , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for fundamental change in the release of the current president , Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , a contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum aimed to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the election alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for the majority from representatives of the opposition after the elections of 2015 .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday , nationwide civil stri@@ fe , and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves sm@@ ote the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government , according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the turn that covers the extent of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches tend to increase more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was audi@@ ted on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities committed in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
now , as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father during the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
the trial ended on 24 August 2016 with crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret .
in the situation at that time I thought that was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Security Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

however , this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child has chosen for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall .
everybody called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP .
be careful not to kid@@ nap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become en@@ vious .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the base of the military base I had to destroy the papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything .

the prisoners are tortured ,
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
on the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks where cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a lot of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I saw in it , and saw a couch that was tortured to men .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
they rarely attached a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and drove him a cargo of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty no@@ od@@ le .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a human being can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied and tied with cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed and killed a man there .
( according to survivors reviews , the civilian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , beat the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ app@@ ings came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the army later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military character , which one has fought against an enemy that one has fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... it is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always asked myself how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , sm@@ ote me and shou@@ ted :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else for that !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but nevertheless brought clothes back home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay a burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the enforced disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last &apos; h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now that I am older , I receive re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one continues to develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why let the bodies disappear ?
why kid@@ nap kids ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people also not have families to give away their mortal remains ?
the enforced disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains forever .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father was during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness for his sake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have been forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then please show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I have been taken . I have finally testi@@ fied against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the verdict in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court found imprisonment for life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ it@@ ances .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped in June 1976 with his pregnant wife and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by im@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the search for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be built there , which is now run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto &apos;s Kyoto city , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ fortun@@ e@@ fied translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ cryp@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with evil thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ some motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ released daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it be such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was removed first . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the excuse :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News spoke a little more detail with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country , however , is quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 % in 2005 . this represents a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors made 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the named re@@ porter revealed comments on the light showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently le@@ ve against older mot@@ orists :
among other things , the article on the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How faul@@ tless the translation is actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to over@@ ride you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires an active command of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French , not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , which could handle translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can nevertheless make translations into the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English language skills are considered to be the best , will be transformed into a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .

machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ati@@ m and enig@@ matic sentences stem@@ ming from machine translations shows that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British phrases in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ ajo con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Fre@@ es surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later on , other users wrote that the Internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also over@@ took photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and writer at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the link was kidn@@ apped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : enabled your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet Service Provider are closed again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ net page .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 in reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible due to a locking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNA server requests specific domains correctly answer requests .
if a site is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies wrong@@ ly or refuses to request such an Internet site .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was broadcast on Thursday 6th April when V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported to regulate internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ aded child as a child . she now visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mean people , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working for the family as Cri@@ mean ta . in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls were forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned is that the children have to work countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean &apos;s - especially young girls were affected by the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , for the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ mean tas is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ mean az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family whom their daughter believes in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of itself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that welcomes the girl and whose exploitation is justified by the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn from it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent be@@ atings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military servant Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the Population Register .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra moved to Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she had fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphasized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the crimes deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they referred to the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a spe@@ edy inquiry into the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean Tat@@ ar .
if the case comes in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n may be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes in court .
the daily life of a Cri@@ mean Tat@@ ar
the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as labor power , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mer in which her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ mean ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still has time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Friday , for example , cleaned the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the home library than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military , and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the owner of the house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , forced to stand beside him and read editorial from opposition papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered them intelligent , but did not stop with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; they meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ Ã­ , would speak at home again their native language Guaran@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , she explains .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ anes that are exposed to Cri@@ mean &apos;s when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ mean ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , during the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and baby girls in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the ad again :
dear friends , I found one . I wonder if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ is@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mean tas , for how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mean tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guaran@@ Ã­ had to pay tribute to them and the native population had to pay tribute to them and the native population went into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and that to show power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill proposes Egyptian social media users to register with the government

published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs today approved a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulate the use and benefit of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up that is t@@ asked to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users and users on the site would have to register with their real names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a sentence of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video chess and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on users and users . it is not clear how they should make up for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , Parliament member and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things dealing with technology .
in my opinion , they are preten@@ ding that same as they control physically public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to court .
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ a@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of the leop@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find ever less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of Leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team finds it in the video that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about sharing another side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protected areas are set up for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ ph@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an accident crash in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had let all coastal towns disappear from the map .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma also experienced a nuclear accident , alone that alone , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ ph@@ o shows from a local point of view , which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the suffer@@ ers themselves .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( all @-@ in @-@ the @-@ house , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned substitute dwell@@ ings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light at 70 percent .
however , six years after the disaster , it is still possible to reloc@@ ate emergency shel@@ ters into final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of people ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who lived after disaster in shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ ed pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , in 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune , the doors opened up until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural lands , with only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this will only be a consequence of the atomic waste , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . it asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling changed against ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ ph@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ consciousness among the native population .
the survey provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough was done regarding disaster prevention .
as it is about those ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o newspaper increased its attention also to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced , atomic accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160@@ ,000 people ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are still in residence , older than 50 years old . they are known to be in proper dwell@@ ings because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries speaking a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , wi@@ den our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a bat@@ on against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against as@@ par@@ ag@@ us throughout the country .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
the doctors operated on him this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police reported in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident by active service .
the pictures show the police officer as he strikes at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his drum@@ stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and all the oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , in which one can see Mat@@ eus being attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are hur@@ rying to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay at Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police force of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group was sab@@ ot@@ aged .
police raid
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which last Friday saw brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators .
in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , police officers set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators by means of loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media fal@@ si@@ fied street protests by ste@@ aling the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were deliberately reporting a broken glass window in order to display their titles illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is concealed by the head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages in Cuba , forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ ati@@ zation
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba concluded the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Municip@@ ality of Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter that there is no considerable sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane plants have been paraly@@ zed .
after that the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some altern@@ ated the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ its daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier &apos;s veter@@ an who runs every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long period of in@@ active time are in operation , because they have been preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene remembered exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane plants were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , published according to the &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repe@@ ating is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents , which were only distinguished in terms of the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility called Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he was building .
with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ tops was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closing of sugar cane plants
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the parish Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich has learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to protest , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they have been replaced .
without prospects of the future , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , the production of which is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring a rent of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to the old soldier to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a bear@@ able person , yet he doesn &apos;t forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is in retirement age 65 , not because he lacks strength , but because he is bitter .

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops managers have been bringing mobile sound studios right to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e communities in North Que@@ bec and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars together .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ mon@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &apos; Highway of tears &apos; , a road section in western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely ignored .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages although the young people didn &apos;t always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ Mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a stroke in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is at your disposal , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if no one ever cared for me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will hear our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also go forward with our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the commentary , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in sy@@ ll@@ ess ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( all @-@ in @-@ all , all @-@ inclusive ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( all @-@ in @-@ all , &quot; Plas@@ tische modell of the courts &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or going on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
near Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new plastic dishes decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that fixes your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple using a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some cell phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
further cur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , all @-@ in @-@ all , all @-@ from @-@ one .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ understand@@ ings and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight brings with them .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel , imp@@ elled the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone find in hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the &quot; ap@@ ling a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; digital project that aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people fighting in the fight between prosec@@ uting authorities and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who died on just one day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
worked in an electric store in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the head@@ lines with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they were ridi@@ cul@@ ing those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they will be spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not troubled and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main district of the city : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals per month black@@ ma@@ iled money from their business until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because they do not know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , boil potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody pse of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looks like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed with organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of kill@@ ings according to the Government of the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and which inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the &quot; ap@@ ling a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; project , Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , with the aim of representing the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this entry and the pages to which he is linked contain images on which violence is presented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something first appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to images trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false pairing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
the representative described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ oped , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the football world championship .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned beyond recognition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ gu@@ r user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident represent the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of cor@@ ded bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photograph has been er@@ ased several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses have reported drastically about atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a human rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been sh@@ at@@ tered , shot or burnt .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be visually represented .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comment@@ aries , such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations describes those who could flee , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported of the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian point of view , wrong@@ ly claimed in 2012 , the President of Burma Th@@ ein Being said , monks and politicians participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to impress this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein Being this statement , but did not make the picture of the DR Congo in connection with it .
the global reach of false data
traces of these false alle@@ gi@@ ances date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture of DR Congo .
they originate from a mix of private pages , social media platforms and collaborative as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of mis@@ use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what they have been published on which page they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been linked with one another ) several examples may stem from mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
examples of false cou@@ plings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples which , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only names the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( DR Congo and beyond ) .

Iran , 2012 .
a group of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the old town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand , a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , since the photos have been mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judge on what to do as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpos@@ ely final news and photos involving international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgement , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech are using and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stimulating yourself by yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site wrong@@ ly asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar has admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic neighbour An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , stated explicitly that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo showed this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed to take place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposedly auth@@ ored by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to ho@@ ax .
from the message containing the image from the DR Congo , the organization of Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye is also indic@@ ative of the Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries associated with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and isolated cases they have picture file names linked to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately contributes to a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally participate in drinking water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it taste the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked of the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers , giving them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent ima@@ gery in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be replaced by context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. re@@ plac@@ eable ) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this word .
these unique words have been gathered in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s tax @-@ sla@@ p language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an your parents in recognition of their efforts in the younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after warming up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite songs here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floods and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally commen@@ ces at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have tro@@ dden over the banks in 15 bor@@ ou@@ ghs in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and just under hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud wave .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people were taken to 304 safe places of residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ all started on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rain@@ falls are already on the way .
this morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in flood water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also flooded due to the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a water level .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and five other five are completed to transport emergency supplies for residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ un@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area today .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the data center is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eving assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .
the Muslims who cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a loving friend .
I confi@@ de in her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we chant rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they were forced to dis@@ arm me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look at all alike .
we practise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , which like me do not fit into it , are de@@ pressed .
become more Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been col@@ oni@@ alizing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should rescue .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ member@@ ed the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ ative nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the US could not even vote for its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and fla@@ wed that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims are in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population is African @-@ stem@@ med Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan imag@@ ines the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ true Muslims and Americans .
but am I ir@@ onic Muslims and Americans now ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t wear all hand@@ ker@@ b@@ ans with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam refin@@ ery machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell her , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that tears a woman down the head@@ sc@@ arf .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but being a Muslim first was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que on the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my friend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual of ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses to the shelter that are called the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging is the image of my grandmother on mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been col@@ oni@@ alized by a &quot; empire &quot; for centuries , which has founded a company called the name of distinguished British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an absolutely wept for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family dominated by India , whom he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , K@@ ash@@ mir subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion things goes back deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over each continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the rate of suicide among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy comes to the United States and the suspect is carrying a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that a West African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ phen , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of 1,7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble cle@@ ann@@ ess of &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders to people from the countries that are bombar@@ ding it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; targeting largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars we are running and the bombs we reject on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at Nor@@ th@@ western University have shown a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that We Have To Do
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to un@@ veil the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous pic@@ torial prints that we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ H , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet been given to them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
things that may ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections of our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to &quot; another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be w@@ aged and people being enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , was even more scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president to feed the chocolate cake , while he already bur@@ sts broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
Initiative for Nar@@ rative Arts aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the nar@@ ration of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honour the diversity of languages in large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
while &quot; listening often is connected to understanding , &quot; these events are meant to &quot; listen to , to appreciate , to make . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not professional story t@@ ellers , their devotion and representation make sure that the audience insi@@ sts on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion as though the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ or Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the tale of the rab@@ bits and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona , Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us asks : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you &apos;ve listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story projections .
Puerto Rico claims US re @-@ determination of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
she was proclaimed by the Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of the debt also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Rico claims that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
Puerto Rico &apos;s people refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining retirement payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Zentrum fÃ¼r Neue Wirtschaft , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
Puerto Rico &apos;s economic and financial crisis requires extensive restructuring of the public infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from extern@@ ally imposed measures will run without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Watch for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the book , which was published last year and is available free of charge , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra Pris@@ on in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information whatsoever about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police Bass@@ el had taken part in a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passing the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more fores@@ ighted than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around the year 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
bass has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ dig@@ al which she wrote to her husband between 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your be@@ wit@@ ching eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all those moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison until 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , director after release res@@ ig@@ ns on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption involving a government member after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison for illegal use of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( some 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from the public funds of Mozambique &apos;s airports , whose council was ruled by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for rein@@ statement to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which den@@ ounced the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer back to his old post , as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to set up the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards regarding the efforts of our judicial system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note of is that the company should also have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary .
the company apparently kept silent and did not set any reasonable legal action for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ am@@ anian social media , likewise re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been served .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ ed !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique designer and student of political science in Brazil , says that the director does not have any mor@@ ale : &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the State because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that one is rewarded in such a way that the state has already so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in jail :
the thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison . not only will Mozambique be remembered as the first independent president , but also a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - prophes@@ ied or@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral accounts was when he for@@ c@@ efully confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is able to sell also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ting b@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted its posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although there is still discussion about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Burma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with very different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written in Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner , if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very much , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analy@@ tic before sol@@ dering all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automati@@ sm won &apos;t understand what you write on fac@@ tre@@ ook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words adjacent .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech are a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to share his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new gui@@ del@@ ine from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to pay , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intent or who simply try to show their views of the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heredi@@ tary cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but were removed anyway :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also intensi@@ fy violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament voted unanim@@ ously for a law forbi@@ dding this practice , so that the age of marriage is now at 18 .
prior to this change in the law , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 a large public scre@@ am occurred . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ th@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been defined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were anxious to aboli@@ sh the laws of child@@ birth , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
however , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent self @-@ contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle had posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one single against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws on the to@@ dd@@ ment had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who held a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has v@@ owed the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? to@@ day@@ ness is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to practice the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly talked about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment to the Act was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs opposed to the law have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the to@@ e @-@ marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ age@@ .@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
however , a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , and the law was to be passed , and he seems to be able to deliver on his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wants to act against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion so general , in a way that can only cause panic and anger , if we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about that the state , our daughters protected from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled males who are facing them , &quot; would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the infant marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .
h@@ acker rolls the office of the prosec@@ utor against national protests at the Russian National Day
screen copy of the message posted on Sunday morning on the Public Prosecutor &apos;s website of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l District .
on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s day - the Russian National Day - the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was hack@@ ed from the district of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l . hack@@ ers left a funny message &quot; Sta@@ y at home .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page - but in the interim storage it remained intact .
it &apos;s # Sa@@ van@@ ished
on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can see the Wikipedia content .
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been spar@@ ing the popular and based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are fighting against blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) are now di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid out all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the domain name system and makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content , however , is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to place sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought forth both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , an error page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country of Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and co @-@ workers at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ ak &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is Wikipedia .
in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ der N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animals to the international stage .
and his home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a leop@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately started to take pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know it , for he stood before the tig@@ ers face to face face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
check out some of these photos below .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version has been reis@@ su@@ ed as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India they avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer grants to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ g has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and manages these clubs .
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was of women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion on the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women could easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom , which they are all du@@ bi@@ tive and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first disc@@ us club with this confidence in luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese from Wal@@ he village in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only chu@@ ck@@ led in front of her during the whole exercise , and another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the disc@@ us club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never been so honest about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ user ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much debate and discussion about the mer@@ its of its own dress code , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion so that the women could carry them .
next , they decided to go on a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will do it .
to the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
we have only done small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say their husband &apos;s name .
some , including myself , still make it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling over more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are in the same boat .
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was launched in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les exclusively in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people that they had no choice but to receive Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Golf Review .
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese do of course make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you must definitely visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges may sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
and of course some companies also make use of the fan base in terms of market technology , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of persons for organ trafficking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ton , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can bring gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia stated to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ ination for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the land :
beware of bald men who travel to Mozambique : men of bald men in Mozambique are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the mos@@ aic police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three @-@ headed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ton , where the assass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ band Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already pursuing the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably ab@@ duc@@ ted rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans .
in recent days , three men with hair fall problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa on Facebook , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE - A country in which people would have shame to go to the streets , to demand sex against good marks , work and other services , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives in order to earn their bread , a country where people would not be ch@@ ased or bald for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to achieve rapid wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor were not to be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro S@@ app@@ r , and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
the Mozambique authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people .

we are deeply shocked to learn about the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in Arabic blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who claimed to be the insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we pay homage to Bass@@ el &apos;s creativity as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we honor the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have been working for his release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
inn@@ um@@ erable of those who were arrested or forci@@ bly removed by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have been put to death in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us &apos;s case as an &quot; internal matter &quot; and tells a spokesman , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release him or give him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations and United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokesman , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume sales to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us as announced on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to lift all the restrictions imposed by Mr. Li@@ us as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treating abroad in so far as he assi@@ sts him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on June 27 that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Embassy insisted on a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany - Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing of the Reu@@ ters news agency reported that China had major concerns whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to contact and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to free the per@@ missions for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
in an explanation on June 29 , France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France will ultimately accept it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of Regional Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called upon China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for his sense of well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ ses@@ sive : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the light of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re comes back from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be Democrats , for@@ sake the distorted logic , since it is better suited to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our dict@@ ator , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage related questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out that it should begin to read the whole document of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it , associates right and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the short@@ com@@ ings of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian messenger ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave significance .
why do people of Singapore pay their military service , but do they defend their city not their own country ?
who must pay back our prime minister &apos;s bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade , tends to be a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct .
we should speak more of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked for me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in anger if they are held for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little difference between Canadi@@ ans and Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - especially Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried on small map@@ le leaves to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if one would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , being &quot; nice &quot; means to be crazy - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward , but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main characteristic of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps is simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now associate with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau explores the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; to Canada .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a popular pop band in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ dy the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took hold of the power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour band describes a young man who tells of which directions he makes his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video indirectly relates to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially about the situation of the country under jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these shots of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army absolute decisi@@ on@@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing the imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict protection against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup in the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax@@ pa@@ yers .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before bringing them to an intern@@ ment camp another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song presented members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em &quot; who was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only re@@ covers very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ en@@ ties , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , mainly Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
more than 10,000 people lived here in pre @-@ war years , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty fif@@ ties floor blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ ko@@ kas , symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elder man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , serving all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty people live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which still houses one or two families , is recognized on balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they retreat right away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us that we let ourselves be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply for@@ ba@@ de us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) , such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago , an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and persi@@ sts in supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while telling her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , it re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball crying .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure that they are innocent in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ MA on April 19 , 2017 .
on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold coloured ear rings in a ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez explains , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she massages them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with their daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ chin ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and three children again .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet her or tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a blind alley leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a stove outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explained that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and do not help others . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova ( Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez ) tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze money out of him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to take .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travellers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones calm@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ ma she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang of t@@ witter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web purification &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app was investigating and prosec@@ uting the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app , with filters for min@@ ors , is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of the users in the larger cities in the east and the south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded , ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( in the first quarter of the country ) , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by training technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the first quarter of the country ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and institutions related to the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office while operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , a U.S. human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an order for all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries out after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything you need to know is gone .
everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both inside and outside .
one that ren@@ ders honour to their name .
one who has fallen into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if reality catches you up and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and all cries out after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth turns on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all districts were cov@@ eted , not my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is stuffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a bit qui@@ eter after the electricity supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we turned to a magnificent picture full of expectations .
at such a moment you realize that you are liber@@ ating the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes looked upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure about my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in solitary confin@@ ement and his father straight away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father straight with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence lies in my nose until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I show all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated to me a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoner and must immediately set me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested way of communication : beating his fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells lay in a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there are no distinctive facial features visible to me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will interro@@ gate immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him when I was staying .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these crow@@ s that were lab@@ elled by the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; still .
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th pro@@ verb@@ s of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their views of the world .
this is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t really tell you when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
on Pun@@ ishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him pleasure ; you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cry .
my cries were not enough for him yet , why they exchanged the tube with a cable .
at my first arrest I asked myself if the investig@@ ator used to work as a collector , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t find any favour in it , which is why he attacked an electrically charged bar .
electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply all my neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say it was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must wor@@ rying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ power@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sw@@ ells to his screen , to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine patch .
he lives in the top floor of his family house which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced himself to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ha@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who is faced with the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones is to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee in the second generation . &quot; he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a person , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water he pour Nes@@ cafÃ© into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you take a look at neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in jail .
recently , the Ministry of the Interior Jord@@ ani@@ ens announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the statement of the concert .
the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was canc@@ eled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which issues the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advocate &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not simply be shallow rhet@@ oric but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ treated traditional sex organs by drawing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ age mor@@ es &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours in 2016 reached its zen@@ ith ; however , further complic@@ ating is that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to provide adequate support for women who have attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 anti @-@ crime control law , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release often requires years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from themes that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was told politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is attacking the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs , which are political in essence , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse repe@@ ats stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which you can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality are still cens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to mark later that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly promotes the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ wa , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ wa , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ?
the real problem , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm , it is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they were critical of the problems related to the corruption that were rooted in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream about bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until it is time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue ra@@ pping and resist@@ ing .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the west of Japan have mar@@ ched to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two trol@@ leys are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and viewed the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a car of 18 metres was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rare outside appearance and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region feel safe .
at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions like the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against bar@@ ber tools and instead of bad advice an apprenticeship in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to meet people who feel alien@@ ated ?
this is exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young Youth Foundation . she inspired her to write letters on reconciliation , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
recently their country was the setting for a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bians , there is a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as , who have lived in illegal detention for many years , were exposed to a rhet@@ or@@ ical rhet@@ oric , and around the clock were carrying out their weapons , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join together and help the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history into a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to transfer the letters in person .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done before , in order to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has someone written something like that , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices , new voices
as a pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state imp@@ acted the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate me , were also only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters answered the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian has been prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and which was first published on the website OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community does not come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that discussed the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ ens and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ lady , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
from her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she eventually moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no longer any men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was writing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything together and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which cases have you been laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I first read his name at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded that I return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that all this was a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me that I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was only bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has damaged not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was lazy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still can &apos;t grasp how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you would be safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still wear some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid inj@@ uring her .
when we chat with camera , I really take pains to look at the person she reminds me of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut out a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were purpos@@ efully sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
since then there has been nothing new from them .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even there when these people were taken along .
up to now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia initially wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ aria security ministry has never cur@@ tail@@ ed me even a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me .
OC Media : how long was this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how the people in the city started to change .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I returned home I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people by themselves when I tap water .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ ants have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think about the identity of males who love men , and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong increase in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video that was shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly made it clear to clear the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died shortly thereafter .
it was not the only suicide which occurred in August inside the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ wn Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all fathers of the family who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work due to the persecution of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi people living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 sustained great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab regions to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youngsters now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Manager for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and graduated from a university degree of 45 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or of Human Rights in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans newly arriving in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not favour Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their native country Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i and be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at work , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i have to endure , human rights activ@@ ist activ@@ ates alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - have fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , women still earn less money than men today despite equal education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and discrimination on the grounds of sex continues across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times under it .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , black female nude women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention whatever kind of body we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; up@@ lift their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose center is the white woman who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner said in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a corrupt and margin@@ alised creature in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimil@@ ation in order to drive forward their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to dis@@ soci@@ ate myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call Separ@@ atism and Exclu@@ sion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern from the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women presents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ ass in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from structural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # gra@@ ci@@ lich@@ ein@@ call@@ rau@@ bin ) , who reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena indicated for mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez reported nothing .
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women at all make an ad , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report themselves at all at law enforcement agencies .
content 1 Stri@@ ps and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that has nothing unter@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation hits and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studio , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are several reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office had 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads used by the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence in the peace courts . here too , 86 % of the advertisements were made by women .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated .
at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this will come to any woman who has been reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse .
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or ex @-@ partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ting her forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer has Carlos together . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable :
I would never have thought that I would ever be a victim of mal@@ treatment .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mal@@ treatment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long gone from Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him sooner .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women , who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s advertisements with the authorities stayed without results and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she ran a process against her former partner , who developed into an obsc@@ ure legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly concerned with money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ sense ) are part of a campaign on Twitter promoted by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare Fem@@ izi@@ d an independent criminal act and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the text of the law was changed in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions banned in Paraguay was banned and pun@@ ishable by up to five years in prison .
the original bill had envis@@ aged that much of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs incurred by the victims of violence themselves , if they simply want to pay a complaint and want a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the legislature provides sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking has to take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing .
whoever keeps silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rator to escape punishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se so long until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered , among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to face attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , serving a one year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid in 1970 , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Deputy Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the reign of Sul@@ t@@ ans is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restricted journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ n@@ ate .
the authorities systematically restrict and prevent peaceful and legitimate human rights activities and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s paper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its foundation in 2007 , corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested on 28 July 2016 following an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties in the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials accused the Supreme Court of Oman to put pressure on a ruling in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS acknow@@ le@@ dges the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper is prohibited on any means , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pressing of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &quot; imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of $ 7@@ 800 in each case ( US $ 7@@ 800 ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was arrested in the amount of $ 5,000 ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i acqu@@ itted the Appe@@ als Court at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month sentence from the Central Pris@@ on in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he served his sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of the Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister asked for another time against the Court &apos;s decision to release the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to set up its operation .
due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities of Japan are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
( 3 ) to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their right human rights work freely and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including legal har@@ ass@@ ments .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic has shown the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Nu@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think of the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay a benef@@ ici@@ ary instead of being a creator himself .
the solutions we get are often not well use@@ able in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how open @-@ source seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been growing salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or car@@ rot varieties . as a result of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but meanwhile he takes longer , as his work is increasingly complicated by ever increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der to which I have to cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents are going too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand in court , no one can breed a new variety of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are patented . &quot; he continues to do as best as possible and tries to breed those features he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries to avoid using any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the USA and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ) is inspired by the open source software movement that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed they bred .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately rinse out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the educated professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by brid@@ ging seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; if you want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered on farmers markets , it should also be known that the manner in which this vegetable is grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others . in contrast to this , their approach is to patent seed and plant traits .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed , as the available gene pool shr@@ inks steadily due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director director of O@@ ss@@ i , worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability .
there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat have been patented like wheat in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown so that they have purpos@@ efully desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves through to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is dimin@@ ishing for breeders by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property is restricted to other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such protection does not prevent innovation , but it promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this in another way : 20 years to wait for a patent to run , certainly not promoting innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mystery of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US State Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values in them .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , cultiv@@ ates into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such companies that move in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative through avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected against competitors for 20 years , which makes it very easy to do in my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
while the USA seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre collabor@@ ates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also assi@@ sts them to get to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not easy to take over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it expresses itself against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed schemes in Ethiopia on which farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open @-@ source seed schemes , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open @-@ source seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should be scheduled next year .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - published a report - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it .
August published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic network for human rights information remains true , despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web pages for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to Egypt on the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog to spread columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government cens@@ orship , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider where the blog is also home , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video explaining how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ aja commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what it means for him :
the way to lock blo@@ gs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i priority ; and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They succeeded in communicating to me the feeling of a state of siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the block@@ ade of blo@@ gs , and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now after they have locked it and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked up from 24 May to 6 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ Ps ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers possible by circum@@ vent@@ ing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
in addition , the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cen@@ sus decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis to act against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far the Egyptian government is ready to go to the cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers across Brazil are reporting with glo@@ omy news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smoke pharmacy with military weapons . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper wrote the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a martial law in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper states that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ ilia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as &quot; war &quot; appeals to violence as a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ ilia it is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rate per state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ ilia , has reiter@@ ated the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police supply and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this did indeed lead to a decline in violent death cases . however , for several years the U@@ PP has been growing under fire after several reports of sham@@ ans and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that are supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 explaining why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people .
this calls for the state to use means and means typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to wins Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Syria Institute research institute , Damascus and the surrounding region , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the region is particularly affected by the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition assume , based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these rebel areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the need for local residents to rely locally made or smu@@ g@@ gled through tunnels and check@@ points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to conventional food @-@ grown foods and are rarely part of the Syrian kitchen . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now becoming more and more known . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to transplan@@ t fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally made plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of mushroom seeds originating from regions &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a bigger tank . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in east Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , car@@ ton , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week called out for solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also recorded in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , a similar tragedy happened , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system monitoring the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery alone , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is only one fire in 4 districts .
all over Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the call for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to reduce the scale of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ ia from the federal government of Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned .
a far reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val further elabor@@ ates in the same article of P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas of eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative supporting the population with information : it used fo@@ gest@@ .@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server didn &apos;t stand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website had more than half a million hits .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , has spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she would not see her son any more - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the Hez@@ bollah @-@ dominated party Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon before the open windows so that we couldn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
at the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are impro@@ vised installations in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be postpon@@ ed for months after the asylum application has been registered .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ k too .
but his un@@ brid@@ led wil@@ fulness helped A@@ shar@@ k to free himself from these conditions .
after working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his total savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was best@@ owed for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have created companies , such as dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant of Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also have Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail , aiming back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k made this trip himself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .
citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws permit the dis@@ sem@@ ination of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ate &apos;s Ne@@ tizen Report is an international sn@@ apshot showing challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft law that stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months of a successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identification number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months of prison sentence or a pen@@ al penalty .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is supposed to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another MP handed a legislative proposal to introduce stric@@ ter pen@@ alties for insul@@ ting the president or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislative proposal , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as the legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for prisoners .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy anyway for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup leading to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree that , among others , weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza reported the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous event , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ gations of Tunisi@@ an activists
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours questioning Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the president of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ law@@ fully preserved mon@@ ies .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April sheds light on how presidential plans look like to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ensures journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , in the district court in Tunis on 9 May , he appeared as a witness in the event .
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to the new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be achieved . it is unclear up to now how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese net@@ workers have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the Land government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that hold the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ n@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as prison in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators have refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication stated that the page had been blocked because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to recru@@ it a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior .
