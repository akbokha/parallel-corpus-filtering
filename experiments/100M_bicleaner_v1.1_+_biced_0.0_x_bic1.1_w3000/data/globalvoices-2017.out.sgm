<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country has such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the grand denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter revealing the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free by Method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only increased.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never thinks behind the mountain as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, received people from all over the world, a deeply faithful man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also Trump Weltanschauung didn't agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "at the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Dumps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to Kristi Kappes' commitment, which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump opened his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters to be racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for dump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget David Remnick's words, which comment on the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(OB.: so much like" "" "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities" "" "; pun play from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means" "" "whiplash" "" "), as the great Van Jones called, has exactly killed what America has done so splendidly." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have always, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "Mr. Khan asked." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices grew louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not be like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, the news said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="68">Image by Flickr-User OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).</seg>
<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero Community in Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura have in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a big landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 pupils became the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The Municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is well known for its drug abuse and banishing violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located virtually at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music and music from the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced by trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material, called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about 1 billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Land fill harmony follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly incensed and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this kind on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to dock at one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused to do anything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he did not succeed in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project, Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. this makes illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the speed of slugs, with information circulating between individual countries, these actions happen in real time, with traceability to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspect activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas, such as those that suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and if they were a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports based on this information, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they may even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The above-mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD from lost turnover that the eight members of the HISH-i network each year lose because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasies, fishing protected species, and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "you purposefully use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an incomplete control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "you mustn't attack my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 researches of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for fighting crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is constantly evolving helps to detect the illegal ships that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which is also concerned with fishery data and provides technical support to FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, so that they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine conservation organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each tracking ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has to run a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without a license and hardly had to face consequences are now aware that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats have more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so powerful that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together to form the West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i.. "safety is the target of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship under false flag, was on the road. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they advance against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the oceans.

<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Venezuelan government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on its release, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness, gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomadepVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country, including in the Barinas area, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north of Carabobo and Isla Margarita in Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continually deteriorates, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for fundamental change in the release of the current president, Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the holding of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, a contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum aimed to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called for the majority from representatives of the opposition after the elections of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday, nationwide civil strife, and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves smote the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There, the demonstrators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government, according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the turn that covers the extent of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was audited on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities committed in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now, as an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father during the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial ended on 24 August 2016 with crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Security Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">However, this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child has chosen for himself a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everybody called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have befriended one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Be careful not to kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become envious.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base I had to destroy the papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, everything.</seg>

<seg id="231">On the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks where cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - everything was possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a lot of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in it, and saw a couch that was tortured to men.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely attached a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and drove him a cargo of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-released daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it be such an English translation?" ""</seg>

<seg id="356">"" "the faulty English translation was removed first. the name" "" "terrible drivers" "" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically correct designation" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by the inadequate correction (translation) of our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are involved in accidents across the country, however, is quite a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 cases of seniors were caused by a total of 19,460% in 2005. this represents a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To override you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active command of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French, not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, which could handle translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can nevertheless make translations into the company. then, the Japanese employee, whose English language skills are considered to be the best, will be transformed into a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbatim and enigmatic sentences stemming from machine translations shows that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least innocuous as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">"" "main page of the portal" "" "Navajo con Libertad" "" "(Frees surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)." ""</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users wrote that the Internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also overtook photographs of the protests in Caracas, organised by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and writer at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the link was kidnapped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: enabled your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan Internet Service Provider are closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlaynet page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitant since 2014 in reporting about protests. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I have registered with @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinintro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible due to a locking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNA server requests specific domains correctly answer requests.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a site is blocked by the DNS, the server replies wrongly or refuses to request such an Internet site.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elapoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third locked channel, was broadcast on Thursday 6th April when VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also been reported to regulate internet connections, making the Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abridged version of a report published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and re-published by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working for the family as Crimean ta. in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls were forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned is that the children have to work countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean's - especially young girls were affected by the Criadazgo's practice - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, for the feeling of gratitude that is injected to the Crimean tas is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crimean azgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family whom their daughter believes in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of itself," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that welcomes the girl and whose exploitation is justified by the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn from it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent beatings. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military servant Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the Population Register.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira moved to Marín as long as she had fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasized that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the crimes deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred to the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to infringe the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a speedy inquiry into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crimean Tatar.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes in court, the case of Carolina Marín may be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes in court.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are not only exploited as labor power, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farmer in which her father worked, had to sign up and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Crimean ta to the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>

<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and circulates in local media including Youm 7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video chess and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on users and users. it is not clear how they should make up for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of the leopards, who fight through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find ever less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of Leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predator is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team finds it in the video that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza is passionate about sharing another side of her country, which is not only made up of war and conflict.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shipho, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an accident crash in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shipo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a number of prefectures in Japan's Northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring counties Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, as the tsunami had let all coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima also experienced a nuclear accident, alone that alone, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shipho shows from a local point of view, which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the sufferers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shipo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (all-in-the-house, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima Prefecture, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 per cent of the planned substitute dwellings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, six years after the disaster, it is still possible to relocate emergency shelters into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of people evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who lived after disaster in shelters, were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three prefeced prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shipo-Zeitung was able to determine, in 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune, the doors opened up until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural lands, with only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this will only be a consequence of the atomic waste, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear ploughing zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shipo-Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation. it asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling changed against tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shipo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shipho conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami-consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey provided that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough was done regarding disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shipo newspaper increased its attention also to the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-induced, atomic accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 people evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima are living outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation centres are still in residence, older than 50 years old. they are known to be in proper dwellings because efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking a different language, the differences appear to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they challenge our prejudices, widen our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music prevailed during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences gathered in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a baton against his head. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against asparagus throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">The doctors operated on him this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures there is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police reported in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident by active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer as he strikes at Goiânia with his drumstick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and all the oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web, in which one can see Mateus being attacked by the police officer and several paramedics are hurrying to him shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay at Goiana while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police force of a WhatsApp group was sabotaged.</seg>

<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which last Friday saw brutal police operations against demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, the Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators by means of loudspeaker announcements.</seg>

<seg id="625">The villages in Cuba, forgotten by the de-industratization</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba concluded the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Municipality of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter that there is no considerable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane plants have been paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After that the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some alternated the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commits daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier's veteran who runs every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long period of inactive time are in operation, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembered exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane plants were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, published according to the "agricultural perspectives" published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will surely go into history," these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane plants, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeating is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents, which were only distinguished in terms of the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility called Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he was building.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important worktops was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it with Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshops managers have been bringing mobile sound studios right to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North Quebec and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsummonum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called' Highway of tears', a road section in western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages although the young people didn't always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the WhapMagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a stroke in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan the verse is at your disposal, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one ever cared for me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also go forward with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (all-in-all, "Plastische modell of the courts") of any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or going on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Near Naver matome the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin dpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new plastic dishes decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an emperor-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that fixes your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple using a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further currile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, all-in-all, all-from-one.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the misunderstandings and killed regularly appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight brings with them.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, impelled the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone find in hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the "apling a Vivir Con El Narco" digital project that aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people fighting in the fight between prosecuting authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the headlines with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they were ridiculing those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaked" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they will be spared by such tragedies when they are not troubled and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the main district of the city: how a family was pillaged with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals per month blackmailed money from their business until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because they do not know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article" "" "Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, boil potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody pse of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed with organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of killings according to the Government of the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office had 3103 murders.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and which invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the "apling a Vivir Con El Narco" project, Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, with the aim of representing the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing falsification.</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the East of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>

<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned beyond recognition.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture entitled" "" "That is Nigeria" "". "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident represent the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of corded bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph has been erased several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses have reported drastically about atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "said a human rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been shattered, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be visually represented.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of misconceptions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal commentaries, such as this example falsely falsify the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations describes those who could flee, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported of the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian point of view, wrongly claimed in 2012, the President of Burma Thein Being said, monks and politicians participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to impress this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news site wrongly asserted that the President of Myanmar has admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events, presumed to take place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was twitched as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retweet), but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally participate in drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and does it taste the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even asked of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent pictures are desensitizing readers and viewers, giving them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent imagery in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be replaced by context or in a completely improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. replaceable) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these confusing words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been gathered in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's tax-slap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Beman your parents in recognition of their efforts in the younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness that you feel after warming up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1125">Things that may arouse memories, as in all the intersections of our humanity, a story may lurk where someone is made to "another."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why am I telling this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars will be waged and people being enthroned by the creation of the "other" in the public imagination, was even more scientist of Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and unconsciously the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president to feed the chocolate cake, while he already bursts broken countries and "to other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, the narration of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honour the diversity of languages in large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often is connected to understanding," these events are meant to "listen to, to appreciate, to make."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story first in their own language and then translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional story tellers, their devotion and representation make sure that the audience insists on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion as though the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, storyteller Rassidator Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamus tells the tale of the rabbits and the baboon in the language of Shona, Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his Fabel, John Nyamus asks: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You've listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story projections.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico claims US re-determination of sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the Puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda (Citizens Front for the re-examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-establishment of the debt also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claims that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for the debts are held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">Puerto Rico's people refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with declining retirement payments.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulce de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'book Sprints' within three to five days read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available free of charge, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra Prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information whatsoever about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken part in a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently passing the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around the year 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and here, Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bass has opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prodigal which she wrote to her husband between 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora entitled "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens every time you visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your bewitching eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose sight in the moment we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers does not matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crowding of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion with me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring back all those moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I persuade myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basle's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in prison until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We reiterate our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption, director after release resigns on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption involving a government member after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for illegal use of 54 million Metikal (some 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of Mozambique's airports, whose council was ruled by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for reinstatement to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which denounced the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to refer back to his old post, as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to set up the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards regarding the efforts of our judicial system," "" "said the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that the company should also have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent and did not set any reasonable legal action for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozamanian social media, likewise rejects this behavior and considers the case "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refuted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"" "" "" "Bitone Viage, young Mozambique designer and student of political science in Brazil, says that the director does not have any morale:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he insulted him. I can't believe that one is rewarded in such a way that the state has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">The thieves belong to Samora Machel prison. not only will Mozambique be remembered as the first independent president, but also a sharp, one-edged and - by the way - prophesied orators.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network adopted its posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although there is still discussion about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the word" "" "in Burma" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with very different meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written in Burmesan 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty manner, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression very much, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytic before soldering all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "automatism won't understand what you write on factreook." ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words adjacent.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech are a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to share his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new guideline from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to pay, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who do not have any negative intent or who simply try to show their views of the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention of reducing racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "hereditary curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has taken care of a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously writing the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech, but were removed anyway:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also intensify violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine region, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have been better to look at context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were anxious to abolish the laws of childbirth, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, not everything went smoothly.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arise whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent self-contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must approve and announce the law.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can see the Wikipedia content.</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been sparing the popular and based encyclopaedia Wikipedia based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated) are now dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid out all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the domain name system and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content, however, is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we set everything to place snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought forth both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, an error page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and co-workers at the Panigrahi's Open Speak "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL, which is not the original. that what you see then is Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese animals to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was and I immediately started to take pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know it, for he stood before the tigers face to face face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been reissued as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India they avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer grants to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pag has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected individuals, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was of women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion on the Patriarchate with a problem with which women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom, which they are all dubitive and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on in his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discus club with this confidence in luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paese from Walhe village in Maharashtra on the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only chuckled in front of her during the whole exercise, and another decided to release all the accumulated frustration of him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead that shows marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discus club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never been so honest about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salwas-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trouser; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much debate and discussion about the merits of its own dress code, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to go on a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say their husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, still make it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling over more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the Hashtag was launched in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles exclusively in London in 1964, noted in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people that they had no choice but to receive Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Golf Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today Beatles-Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese do of course make pilgrimages to the well-known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you must definitely visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages may sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today Beatles-Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same we did last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also make use of the fan base in terms of market technology, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "today I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "and eat Ramen noodles at the" "" "Mutaro Koya" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milton, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can bring gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia stated to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassination for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1596">Beware of bald men who travel to Mozambique: men of bald men in Mozambique are the aim of ritualistic attacks, warned the mosaic police according to the latest assassinations of three-headed men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milton, where the assassinations took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husband Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already pursuing the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably abducted rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair fall problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of blogger's poor Snaippa on Facebook, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE - A country in which people would have shame to go to the streets, to demand sex against good marks, work and other services, a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives in order to earn their bread, a country where people would not be chased or bald for superstitious purposes or "black magic," which aim to achieve rapid wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humor were not to be missed.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweetete that both the chief of the Morrumbala district, Pedro Sappr, and the police spokesperson Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both bald:</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel laureates and dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state threat) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius's case as an "internal matter" and tells a spokesman, he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release him or give him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations and United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Børge Børge refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume sales to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius as announced on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift all the restrictions imposed by Mr. Lius as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans" "" "wish him the possibility of treating abroad in so far as he assists him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on June 27 that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the U.S. Embassy insisted on a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told us that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing of the Reuters news agency reported that China had major concerns whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on China to provide adequate medical care to Liu and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to contact and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to free the permissions for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In an explanation on June 29, France's Foreign Ministry called for China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information on whether France will ultimately accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Regional Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu-Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called upon China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for his sense of well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shanmugam were not very possessive: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the light of this, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre comes back from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be Democrats, forsake the distorted logic, since it is better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our dictator, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflage related questions with non-replies rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out that it should begin to read the whole document of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew by Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it, associates right and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the shortcomings of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam" "" "faithfully committed a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian messenger?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do people of Singapore pay their military service, but do they defend their city not their own country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister's bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade, the magazine Journey of a Decade, tends to be a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements like "the defense of the country especially" etc., but this is not quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak more of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1745">"" "my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" "" "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." "" "many Canadians perhaps cook in anger if they are held for Americans, but it doesn't bother me." ""</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little difference between Canadians and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everyone loves Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - especially Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First of all, being "nice" means to be crazy - like the benevolent, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure of Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has an own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward, but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main characteristic of Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A popular pop band in Thailand released a music video that parody the junta, which in 2014 took hold of the power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>

<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially about the situation of the country under junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these shots of the video, which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the Army absolute decisionmaking over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosecuted persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict protection against "Lese Majeste" (majesty insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there was a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before bringing them to an internment camp another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold coloured ear rings in a teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. Ramírez explains, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, buys them drugs that they can't pay, she massages them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1926">He says that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are talking about Whatsapp of Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet her or tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a blind alley leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"" "" "" "this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their little house." ""</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a stove outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explained that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>

<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova (Meléndez) tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze money out of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to take.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travellers consult their telephones calmly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjiang of twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web purification").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the" "" "app" "" "will prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app was investigating and prosecuting the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, online scams, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with filters for minors, is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of the users in the larger cities in the east and the south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded, ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (in the first quarter of the country), published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiang ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by training technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(in the first quarter of the country) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and institutions related to the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office while operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, a U.S. human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an order for all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Empowerlam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he swells to his screen, to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine patch.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced himself to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as felhayees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who is faced with the conservative majority and questioned her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special reluctance against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones is to do anything with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee in the second generation." he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "Hdaib emphasizes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a person," "" "while in water he pour Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you take a look at neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of the Interior Jordaniens announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the statement of the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was canceled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which issues the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to advocate "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not simply be shallow rhetoric but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib retreated traditional sex organs by drawing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honourage mores' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honours in 2016 reached its zenith; however, further complicating is that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to provide adequate support for women who have attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 anti-crime control law, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release often requires years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was told politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib is attacking the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are political in essence, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse repeats strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which you can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality are still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to mark later that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a modified version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly promotes the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwa, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwa, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph later, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemian realm, it is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they were critical of the problems related to the corruption that were rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream about bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also about" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially-led democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is time, Hdaib will continue rapping and resisting.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the west of Japan have marched to the Northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two trolleys are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare outside appearance and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the Friseure "Batalla de Barberos," which takes place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against barber tools and instead of bad advice an apprenticeship in the hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to meet people who feel alienated?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Bogotart Foundation and Cristian Palacios of the Young Youth Foundation. she inspired her to write letters on reconciliation, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the setting for a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "however, in front of the Colombians, there is a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who have lived in illegal detention for many years, were exposed to a rhetorical rhetoric, and around the clock were carrying out their weapons, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, on Valentine's day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history into a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to transfer the letters in person.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done before, in order to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "then I asked him," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never in my life has someone written something like that, so I answer." "" "suddenly tears ran across the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices, new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">As a prelude, students and some of the FARC leaders joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state impacted the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate me, were also only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian has been prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that discussed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milashina in Nowaya Gazeta, throwing a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queens and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything together and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases have you been laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded that I return to Chechnya in order to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me that I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grozny and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was only bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has damaged not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't grasp how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you would be safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditionally Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid injuring her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really take pains to look at the person she reminds me of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were purposefully submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there has been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even there when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was applied, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia initially wanted to introduce us to" "" "civilized" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "the Sharia security ministry has never curtailed me even a hair." ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at first looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I returned home I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people by themselves when I tap water.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to prophesy with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dageants have which, the Cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they are - but" "" "not in Chechnya" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about the identity of males who love men, and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong increase in suicide since the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahvtsi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video that was shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly made it clear to clear the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which occurred in August inside the Arab Ahrazi Minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shawn Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all fathers of the family who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work due to the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which most of the Arab Ahwazi people living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 sustained great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ahwazi-Arabs to create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the waters from the Arab regions to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local farming as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Manager for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and graduated from a university degree of 45%.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor of Human Rights in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians newly arriving in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not favour Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their native country Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation with the Ahvtsi and be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at work, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahvtsi have to endure, human rights activist activates alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - have frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money than men today despite equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and discrimination on the grounds of sex continues across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and three times under it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black female nude women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention whatever kind of body we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "uplift their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to sing" to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is institutionalized form of racist violence, which we are exposed to black women in twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose center is the white woman who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner said in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a corrupt and marginalised creature in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimilation in order to drive forward their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissociate myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call Separatism and Exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither skipped nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" from structural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# gracilicheincallraubin), who reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another wife Balbuena indicated for maltreatment, Ada Báez reported nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women at all make an ad, they generally do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report themselves at all at law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Strips and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that has nothing unternimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institute in Paraguay. "there are several reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General's Office had 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads used by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 adverts due to domestic violence in the peace courts. here too, 86% of the advertisements were made by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated.</seg>
<seg id="2498">At the end of 2014, two women who do not do this will come to any woman who has been reimbursed for physical abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or ex-partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then gave up. this should be regretting her forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer has Carlos together. but for two years she endured the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would ever be a victim of maltreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming her name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of maltreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long gone from Carlos and didn't leave him sooner.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women, who are all victims of abuse in any way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case, everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorian's advertisements with the authorities stayed without results and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She ran a process against her former partner, who developed into an obscure legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly concerned with money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2529">A bill was debated in the Paraguayan parliament on 10 August 2016, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nonsense) are part of a campaign on Twitter promoted by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to declare Femizid an independent criminal act and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the text of the law was changed in some points to also win the deputies for the law which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions banned in Paraguay was banned and punishable by up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had envisaged that much of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs incurred by the victims of violence themselves, if they simply want to pay a complaint and want a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective unless the legislature provides sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking has to take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been altered, among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic has shown the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Nubian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think of the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay a beneficiary instead of being a creator himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well useable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines are only accessible for payment (the so-called" "" "paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how open-source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been growing salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carrot varieties. as a result of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeds salad, but meanwhile he takes longer, as his work is increasingly complicated by ever increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river there is a boulder to which I have to cycle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents are going too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand in court, no one can breed a new variety of lettuce, because all the features are patented. "he continues to do as best as possible and tries to breed those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to avoid using any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the USA and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the OutredGorgeous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Open Source Seed Initiative) is inspired by the open source software movement that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed they bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately rinse out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the educated professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by bridging seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "if you want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered on farmers markets, it should also be known that the manner in which this vegetable is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others. in contrast to this, their approach is to patent seed and plant traits.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardised, as the available gene pool shrinks steadily due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director director of Ossi, worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat have been patented like wheat in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have purposefully desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves through to such, because they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is diminishing for breeders by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property is restricted to other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not prevent innovation, but it promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this in another way: 20 years to wait for a patent to run, certainly not promoting innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a mystery of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety breeds his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass herbicides are needed, cultivates into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such companies that move in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative through avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent, one is protected against competitors for 20 years, which makes it very easy to do in my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the USA seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open-source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre collaborates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also assists them to get to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation is not easy to take over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016 the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it expresses itself against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed schemes in Ethiopia on which farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for open-source seed schemes, states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open-source seed systems for which the official start-up should be scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for human rights information remains true, despite this attack and the ridicule of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page of Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web pages for victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to Egypt on the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog to spread columns and articles, which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government censorship, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider where the blog is also home, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video explaining how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziaja commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The way to lock blogs is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They succeeded in communicating to me the feeling of a state of siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blockade of blogs, and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked it and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked up from 24 May to 6 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers possible by circumventing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the census decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis to act against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far the Egyptian government is ready to go to the censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers across Brazil are reporting with gloomy news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves smoke pharmacy with military weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published on 16 August published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced a new column called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper wrote the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a martial law in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper states that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecilia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as "war" appeals to violence as a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. photo by Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecilia it is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is at No. 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecilia, has reiterated the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police supply and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this did indeed lead to a decline in violent death cases. however, for several years the UPP has been growing under fire after several reports of shamans and repressions against the poor communities that are supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 explaining why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use means and means typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object of "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to wins Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the Syria Institute research institute, Damascus and the surrounding region, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region is particularly affected by the region of East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations, and the Syrian opposition assume, based on UN investigations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">"" "" "" "since 2013, these rebel areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the need for local residents to rely locally made or smuggled through tunnels and checkpoints." ""</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to conventional food-grown foods and are rarely part of the Syrian kitchen. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now becoming more and more known. "</seg>

<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families to transplant fungi, so Dr. Leila leads to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to Cando by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally made plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of mushroom seeds originating from regions" before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom-yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a bigger tank. and so on.</seg>

<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in east Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week called out for solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also recorded in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande, a similar tragedy happened, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system monitoring the forest areas via satellite imagery alone, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas of eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, spread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative supporting the population with information: it used fogest.pt's own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the server didn't stand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website had more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time Ashark Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, has spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan.</seg>

<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "said Ashark in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon before the open windows so that we couldn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Ashark was homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "", "which are improvised installations in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be postponed for months after the asylum application has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either reliant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Ashark too.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled wilfulness helped Ashark to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After working in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his total savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was bestowed for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghans have created companies, such as dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant of Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also have Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharafs targets go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail, aiming back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark also plans to open a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark made this trip himself. now he would like to help other Afghans in this way.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocate's Netizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft law that stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months of a successful legal decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months of prison sentence or a penal penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is supposed to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another MP handed a legislative proposal to introduce stricter penalties for insulting the president or high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislative proposal, such action would, however, be punished with prison and fines, such as the legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in jeopardy anyway for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup leading to the removal of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in jail for a trial date." ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree that, among others, weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza reported the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous event, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogations of Tunisian activists</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours questioning Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the president of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unlawfully preserved monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April sheds light on how presidential plans look like to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which ensures journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, in the district court in Tunis on 9 May, he appeared as a witness in the event.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be achieved. it is unclear up to now how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese networkers have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective to protect citizen journalism and independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register in the Land government as" "" "organiser of the distribution of information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that hold the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnclassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court had the Wikipedias prison in Turkey, after Wikipedia's administrators have refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication stated that the page had been blocked because it was" "" "a source of information that collaborates with groups to recruit a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation is still ongoing until 19 May. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
