this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter at all ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en was ris@@ king the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential in their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped on ri@@ fts .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of failing and tear@@ ing cracks , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , have kept his telephone references secret .
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit information , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack @-@ supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his arrival , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more convic@@ ted than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just like the government &apos;s technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they get in contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet world , which was developed by us Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website such as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure more information secretly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technological men such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility of t@@ apping mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the nearest environ@@ ment@@ alist who al@@ erts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news of a leak of 11 million documents of the Law Fir@@ m Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a based in Panama .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agency ri@@ ll@@ ers or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be weeping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society to really understand what is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans yet who came in these revelations expos@@ ing this scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , there is less information in some US states to provide less information to set up a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all of us had suggestions on how to transfer his money to one of our investig@@ ators .
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to anyone but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
this may sound very foolish as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I am quite aware that something has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen pr@@ elimin@@ aries to more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject attracted political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central regimes at a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA hin@@ ders here .
representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see other people hiding their true identity behind fake labels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back yard selling .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my clothes .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , star@@ ing at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in there ?
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed on ti@@ p@@ toes to the door and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and founded so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air matt@@ resses on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese pro@@ sci@@ ut@@ to @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ach czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting is over .
over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in the hand .
now I would like you to unlock your cell phone .
put your locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbor .
this quiet flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
only once , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phone ?
could you please spread on Twitter that he is running for President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones back .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told him where he came from , how his dog or his children would be hot ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements , all of which say : &quot; he can really capture very well @-@ born mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before ordering them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
we trust the people that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when adding a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out for simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re talking too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example , &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m doing holidays with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with a design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not been met before .
for us , the business is just going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to party or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately of the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction of each had a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
if trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is going on .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade here .
but it is not just the &quot; rental industry , &quot; but the thing is not fair .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is possible to compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show you a quarter of which you have never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to the next ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking spaces included in the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
they were taught to people whose children had been deprived of . incu@@ bat@@ ors were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality has existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has it just worked ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or is it supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I &apos;ll tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lady -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as homos@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was for me a feminist declaration of independence , and against the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ re@@ achable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents pas@@ sively .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you fully , and yet loves you somehow ?
that is how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ ert &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock rapidly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such a thing ?
I changed the television channel and heard , ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; Middle Eastern par@@ ent@@ age ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start a post@@ graduate course .
I remember how I -- when we were silent -- how deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations saying , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
and again the warnings came : &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were thought to be Muslims , dra@@ gged into the open and sm@@ ashed .
there were really surge attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have de@@ fied the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to be self @-@ explan@@ atory .
I have nothing against any questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we start it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the United States .
it only raises the question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces available , but not to stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a head of the police in Washington , DC recently told me : people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can bra@@ in@@ washing , which leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a beli@@ ever .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their world of imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if you submit messages that have been neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they rather agree on military attacks against Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims f@@ lowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we feel it perhaps the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when it comes to the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the Dental Fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such an accomplished young man come out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was what America wanted us to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove quietly , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congreg@@ ations were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had prepared courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ CC , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be deceived . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any respect .
when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air package delivery came into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower made of 1 500 bricks . several years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting links , flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
they can also build self @-@ reli@@ eving structures .
they have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to laws of nature .
today , we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possibility in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with one flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the essence of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which only had two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one thing works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the most mechan@@ ically simple remote control device . it was invented recently .
it has only one mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is simple mechanical , there is a lot of space inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the likel@@ ihood of seeing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in in@@ suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is just symmet@@ ric .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
as a result , it receives the au@@ d@@ acious skill ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers among the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned right by flying .
let us take a look at this .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller dies off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic sho@@ als .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ squares -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine on the floor would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , clever creatures are allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes en@@ cir@@ cled each other in a very far @-@ away gal@@ axy . they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
this short moment they den@@ ounced more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy , however , did not set them in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago , there was just a few days of life on Earth .
since then , the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands by -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which form through colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized her as mad genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition efficiency .
this is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes passed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically , this was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its content are stretched in one direction and cra@@ cked into the other .
teachers in classes on the theory of rel@@ ativity often have a really al@@ ber@@ ty dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and cra@@ cked by us at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o employees declared ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you coming from multiple points .
with sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by looking at changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity , we can tell about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very fast , one hears the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Any@@ one who knows what to hear knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn approximately as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : let us briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle around a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
in this there is the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing the way for an entirely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes , however , occur at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are opa@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own light .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that bring out black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ erk@@ raut for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the universe .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if I was nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , weighed down my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ e@@ the@@ art , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir you up to life .
perfect job .
no .
I am a Titan .
perfect job .
I cra@@ ve television . I produce television .
I make TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days by four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that simultaneously are in production four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes :
$ 350 million for a season .
in America , my TV shows run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is still doing it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
perfect job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a house , take me seriously when I &apos;m talking about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just playing around on the computer and I &apos;m saying , I understand it &apos;s not about dreaming during a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I go into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
as a bear@@ er of a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever on it .
many people accept when I tell them the tot@@ um that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the h@@ um -- when I began to work and to work and to work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the tot@@ als !
the tot@@ um is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the tot@@ um is a drug .
the tot@@ um is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz@@ ing , then you can &apos;t strive to be different from size .
the feeling of not being different than to strive for size does not matter at what price .
this is called the tot@@ um .
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not going to fail , and I just know that I love the tot@@ um .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this h@@ um . I love the tot@@ als .
I need the tot@@ um . I am the tot@@ um .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ hau@@ led , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming stopped .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ led .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan never sleeps , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the tot@@ um and the tot@@ um was me .
so what can you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ vent you , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do what you do , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , being a bank@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and you know how the tot@@ um feels when you know the tot@@ als once you stop , who is you ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern partner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become conscious of me :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , it did not call me &quot; swe@@ aring . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ aring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m titanium and bu@@ stle my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in soli@@ tude and in the absence of the sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets loose .
everywhere peace and simplicity are .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly returns .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the tot@@ als , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ um , the working environment , the titanium um@@ um , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I am describing programs and TV hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the tot@@ um is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
true tot@@ als depend on love .
the tot@@ um is the current that comes from the lust of life .
true sw@@ amp is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true tot@@ als ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from all guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the tot@@ als again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t like playing the way I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person does he prefer to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
we grass in the garden , in front and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream woman .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes before they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaces me .
and talk to my teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , there is no need anymore .
everyone can spend 15 minutes in the play , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes in the play !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are making a bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for the peace of the soul .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s all about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s good for you .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the tot@@ um came back in my spare time . the tot@@ um seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the tot@@ als , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ um of love .
the sums of work are part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is bu@@ zz@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land that I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the other , the right h@@ um : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new attitude of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
that is why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; it im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence neur@@ ons &quot; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with a skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , one has to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
allowing cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François created .
he saw that under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly the same as a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved otherwise .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have it in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so sure .
one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we reim@@ ported them at the reception point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ import these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in a damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there so they disappear .
in the second scenario we inserted an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are those little points . these are the cells we colored in vitro , in culture .
of course , we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take for@@ age pellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the mot@@ oric area in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously re@@ plen@@ ished to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who spontaneously collected .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we re @-@ imported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you , these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable const@@ ern@@ ation .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would aboli@@ sh it if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mur@@ mu@@ red , our future glo@@ omy , and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin top parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
but few realize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income to bring down the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the US , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so forth and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sound like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and drive up real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that cannot compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are job@@ less , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like in a final loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which they do not invest in .
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the killing of O@@ edi@@ pus in killing him .
that is my hair with capitalism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive which it granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal temper@@ ament in matters of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle took place between the two , and the economy gradually under@@ mined policy and em@@ powers them .
wondering why politicians are no longer the way they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today you can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which has decim@@ ated the animals from which it is nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar with the economy which has chann@@ eled politics so far that it itself hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , the inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring back politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and pay attention to democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used to humans and people inf@@ use their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the company : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no more distinction between those who belong to the company , who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no overl@@ apping twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ anism .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
what is the relevance of Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do not , technological development will produce such a massive drop in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls for &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely confused .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you keep from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays is the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the nin@@ eteenth century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the lasting denial that a massive rej@@ ecting line has passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have also voted for denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the proposal to extend the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t happen .
they merely wanted to bring down our government simply because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ op@@ ers who imposed this policy on us stood up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they don &apos;t survive the released flow forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the road of a post @-@ modern 1930 that it seems to me , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for checking the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this assessment received .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; all the shows that addic@@ ted , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is more concerned about the medium output , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he has to make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and el@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon gets things out for free , do you take up too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when viewing these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes things different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com against four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data versi@@ fied firms .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you are making , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company of Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s fine .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is a dis@@ miss@@ al or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis was able to predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked imp@@ ec@@ cable , year by year , until it suddenly ceased to work .
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data is increasingly pouring into decisions of life -- at work , at law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know a lot of difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably use lots of data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break down a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they made a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data tell us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will then f@@ use it with a technique demo later .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , where I should have listened in retro@@ sp@@ ect to the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the large amount of data , it is still paying out to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
