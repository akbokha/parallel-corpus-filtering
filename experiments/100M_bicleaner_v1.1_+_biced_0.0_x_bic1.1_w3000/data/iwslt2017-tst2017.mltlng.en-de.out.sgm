<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally heard telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally handed over drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was risking the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential in their case, the government's demands were dropped on rifts.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and tearing cracks, they could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his agreement, have kept his telephone references secret.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit information, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack-supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his arrival, but instead the judiciary has more convicted than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they get in contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmittance system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet world, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure more information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technological men such as Edward Snowden have the possibility of tapping misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the nearest environmentalist who alerts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news of a leak of 11 million documents of the Law Firm Mossack Fonseca based in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agency rillers or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by a few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society to really understand what is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans yet who came in these revelations exposing this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, there is less information in some US states to provide less information to set up a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all of us had suggestions on how to transfer his money to one of our investigators.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to anyone but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very foolish as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I am quite aware that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen preliminaries to more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject attracted political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has gathered in central regimes at a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA hinders here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see other people hiding their true identity behind fake labels.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leaders who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a back yard selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my clothes.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the corps of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "Oh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I rock in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed on tiptoes to the door and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and founded so" "" "air mattresses and breakfast" "" "[AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese prosciutto-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleach czyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting is over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Put your locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please spread on Twitter that he is running for President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones back.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told him where he came from, how his dog or his children would be hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements, all of which say: "he can really capture very well-born mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before ordering them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when adding a person's reputation -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you're talking too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, for example, "Great works of art in your home! I'm doing holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with a design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is just going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to party or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately of the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction of each had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wondrous can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "a perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing coincide with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is not just the "rental industry," but the thing is not fair.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is possible to compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show you a quarter of which you have never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to the next?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking spaces included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">They were taught to people whose children had been deprived of. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or is it suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I'll tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lady -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: back then it was for me a feminist declaration of independence, and against the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents passively.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, understands you fully, and yet loves you somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">That is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I got married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "Eilert" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock rapidly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard,... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..." "Middle Eastern parentage..."... "Jihad..."... "bombed Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country that has been attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start a postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I -- when we were silent -- how deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations saying, "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't be sampled."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings came: "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were thought to be Muslims, dragged into the open and smashed.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surge attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have defied the anger of the people to the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to be self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against any questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually hear people saying:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it's Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">"" "when will we start it?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces available, but not to stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in Washington, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family so that the extremists can brainwashing, which leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a believer.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their world of imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology based on their" "" "holy book." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists that promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if you submit messages that have been negatively reported about Muslims, they rather agree on military attacks against Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood against Muslims flowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We feel it perhaps the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When it comes to the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the Dental Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did such an accomplished young man come out of my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be fatal, not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was what America wanted us to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove quietly, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregations were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had prepared courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TEDCC, a thinker with a draught, working in a noble mindset, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be deceived. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery came into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower made of 1 500 bricks. several years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting links, flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-relieving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at highest level. for example," "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the essence of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one thing works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the most mechanically simple remote control device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is simple mechanical, there is a lot of space inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of seeing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in insufficiency, this machine is here, the Omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is just symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the audacious skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers among the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned right by flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller dies off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic shoals.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-squares -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine on the floor would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, clever creatures are allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes encircled each other in a very far-away galaxy. they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they denounced more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy, however, did not set them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, there was just a few days of life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands by -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which form through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized her as mad genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferomet- gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, this was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their by observatories like ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its content are stretched in one direction and cracked into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Teachers in classes on the theory of relativity often have a really alberty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and cracked by us at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average human was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by 1. therefore, the Ligo employees declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light around you coming from multiple points.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just speaks Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is interrupting her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "thank you Bob." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo there are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, we can tell about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very fast, one hears the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] Anyone who knows what to hear knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn approximately as fast as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving the way for an entirely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, occur at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by his own light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that bring out black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sauerkraut for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year, I would say" "" "yes!" "" "I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if I was nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, weighed down my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "estimating" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "sweetheart, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, stir you up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Perfect job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Perfect job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I crave television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days by four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that simultaneously are in production four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes:</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV shows run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Perfect job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a house, take me seriously when I'm talking about work, so you understand that I'm not just playing around on the computer and I'm saying, I understand it's not about dreaming during a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a bearer of a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I tell them the totum that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the hum -- when I began to work and to work and to work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the totals!</seg>
<seg id="618">The totum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totum is action and activity. the totum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totum is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzzing, then you can't strive to be different from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than to strive for size does not matter at what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the totum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not going to fail, and I just know that I love the totum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things are at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the totals, the totals, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the totum. I am the totum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overhauled, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Eating, I want to go to Shonda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzzled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan never sleeps, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the totum and the totum was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what can you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly faded away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "havent you, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do what you do, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, being a bankker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and you know how the totum feels when you know the totals once you stop, who is you?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern partner" "" "waitress asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way outside, late, and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become conscious of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, it did not call me "swearing."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "swearing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm titanium and bustle my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the summing, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" lets loose.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly returns.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no mystery. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totum, the working environment, the titanium umum, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I am describing programs and TV hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True totals depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True swamp is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True totals ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic from all guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the totals again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't like playing the way I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person does he prefer to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We grass in the garden, in front and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naive, for a daydream woman.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It's only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes before they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talk to my teenie daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are making a bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the totals, to have a place for the peace of the soul.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totum came back in my spare time. the totum seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the totals, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the totum, the totum is not me... no more.</seg>

<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." it implanted an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence neurons "circuits in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with a skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is swollen and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one has to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Allowing cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François created.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly the same as a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have it in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they are responsible for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimported them at the reception point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-import these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we inserted an injury and reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are those little points. these are the cells we colored in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course, we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forage pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motoric area in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hands any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously replenished to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who spontaneously collected.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we re-imported the cells: the same monkey, two months after the explantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies.</seg>

<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>

<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to launch it soon?</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable consternation.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abolish it if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are murmured, our future gloomy, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which is currently threatening our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin top paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few realize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income to bring down the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the US, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so forth and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sound like a lot of money until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to inflate stock exchanges and drive up real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that cannot compensate for the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are jobless, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like in a final loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which they do not invest in.</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances lead to the killing of Oedipus in killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to mitigate the value of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing in the Athenian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive which it granted them the right to political co-determination with equal temperament in matters of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable struggle took place between the two, and the economy gradually undermined policy and empowers them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer the way they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today you can be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is migrated to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, which has decimated the animals from which it is nourished, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar with the economy which has channeled politics so far that it itself hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being exploited, the inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing directors of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring back politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we need to restructure the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and pay attention to democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film" "" "Matrix" "" "like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," in which machines are used to humans and people infuse their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athens "Agora," in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No more distinction between those who belong to the company, who do not work therein, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no overlapping twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunited policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global keynesianism.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "Matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do not, technological development will produce such a massive drop in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls for "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you keep from the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays is the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say that provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to the complacency and the lasting denial that a massive rejecting line has passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have also voted for denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism in life, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the proposal to extend the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't happen.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government simply because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troopers who imposed this policy on us stood up:" "" "it was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they don't survive the released flow forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the road of a post-modern 1930 that it seems to me, it will also be tolerable for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for checking the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this assessment received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "," "" "" Game of Thrones "" "," "" "" The Wire "" "," all the shows that addicted, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "" "" where are there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price doesn't care to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to entertain" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He is more concerned about the medium output, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gets things out for free, do you take up too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when viewing these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes things different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom against four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data versified firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you are making, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, this is something frightening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company of Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's fine.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is a dismissal or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis was able to predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked impeccable, year by year, until it suddenly ceased to work.</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data is increasingly pouring into decisions of life -- at work, at law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know a lot of difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people inconceivably use lots of data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break down a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they made a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data tell us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will then fuse it with a technique demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far, where I should have listened in retrospect to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the large amount of data, it is still paying out to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
