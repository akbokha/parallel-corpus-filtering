Munich , 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former land of farmers .
the oldest official map Munich promotes exciting stories on days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but that is why it is very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which one does not recognise as such .
in the large overview map , detailed maps , so @-@ called original compositions , were incorporated into towns and municipalities .
these were based on figures from the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original composition for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was produced , i.e. in 18@@ 77 when the Munich subur@@ b was incorporated .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at the zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the base tax was deduc@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; little par@@ c@@ els now show no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the October festival since 18@@ 10 , actually was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ asylum @-@ institute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden under@@ took the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the Ank@@ le of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also prohibited the personnel to resort to violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was room for 280 patients , and more than 500 seats were added later .
at some point this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k ren@@ ding facility in hair in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 .
young people meet at the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former prison .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected in the architectural style of the original building of the asylum , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the shopping street called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were preceded by the preparations and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ up .
with the sli@@ ders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizens &apos; rights group publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Pro@@ mot@@ ing Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the statement of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as prosec@@ uting authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to issue a warning message , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will stop 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring some deposit money or let the relatives know they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report set by the FBI , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th position of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws , obli@@ ging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further racial appropri@@ ation .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have implemented the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ jured @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the members of the CD@@ U , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac , have taken a picture on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recht@@ gra@@ ben@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ates in five apartments holiday palaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ este is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V President of Fis@@ her@@ man , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crossover project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area care for a lot of work , much needed to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not lead to organic farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the Leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they can continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often critic@@ ised for the promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 via the electric fence promotion .
the open @-@ air area therefore amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be aff@@ or@@ ested up to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost amoun@@ ting to 71 500 Euros , one half was supported by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ man .
the farmers therefore remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of fence magic .
&quot; the great advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ ladies it is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape conservation directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of wil@@ low f@@ ences .
the aim is to disclose the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
moreover , the area to be en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ed must not be har@@ dy ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the 2018 fishing relay project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open @-@ air area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 1,000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ on &apos;s square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the proposals of the president for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue herself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ mobili@@ zers would have liked him if he had done it .
but he resor@@ ted to its significance , and especially the meaning that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta stated , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem that you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s vibr@@ ating words , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ ans by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classical visual presentation .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus has changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives that will bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch will not give light on the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels on the deck of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognise .
their torch is not to ligh@@ ten the road , but ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black dresses Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship header &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developing in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her captain speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the medium @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this road and last year set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in 1500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was supposed to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the crew captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be mixed with the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Scot@@ ts that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the over@@ heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long for the newspapers to strike him for anything , from home politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the criticism , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
it has the second @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum classified as official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Mr A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just true people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ iting .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith in Ho@@ gans .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked about hate crimes .
&quot; I commented polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck his leadership .
even back then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting it .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led alongside Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because she was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we always value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the Hel@@ ens@@ burgh guy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how things went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by pas@@ siv@@ ity
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Medical Center ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said coordinator Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer cases due to second@@ hand smoke each year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic inclu@@ sions prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic that obstruc@@ ts construction work again and again poses a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction firm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting already . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use cooker .
it rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the rest@@ less Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example , to wash clothes with opa@@ que water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch regime quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea consisted of the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is boring . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and corru@@ gated sheets , which have been converted by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago rever@@ ed Pap@@ u@@ ans a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , over wood resources are valued at $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the part of Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port was paying close to $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy are threatening these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s were part of the Gen@@ o@@ cide by the Asia Commission of Human Rights .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police last year arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; is written in a report by the Erz@@ di@@ ö@@ z@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on the atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric shock are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua ( the women &#93; of Papua has cost off their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ the@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua in 2014 during its campaign .
the former carp@@ enter won 27 of the 29 territories of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua has little changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ the@@ i , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ovi@@ is initiation , Pan@@ i@@ ai had a low point in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs before a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an attack on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk drove and sm@@ ote the group with their rif@@ le @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was severely beaten to fall into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ aking still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin was the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who just bore a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers would only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because it was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman for the Papua @-@ police commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings only came &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks ago , in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ the@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ ung to tackle the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , security minister Wir@@ anto said that he would set up an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for resol@@ ving historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the United Nations has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; claiming more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother , Y@@ ac@@ obus , repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning subsidies .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so panic , we were afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the police bri@@ gade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trou@@ ble@@ maker of the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the Free State Army ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the State by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is also out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between native countries and new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or necessary skills to keep their own companies competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no job or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far off from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch deputy Asia Director , the promises made by Jok@@ ic &apos;s election campaign to raise the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local governments want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ the@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai kis@@ sing , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that the people of the Pan@@ i@@ ai know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai said that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ the@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ cas@@ u@@ alties were the last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire gather the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swept through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch @-@ tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and shou@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said that she was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can rev@@ ital@@ ise questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the outer covering to the decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain the police said that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the pro @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single on two winning races was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although these often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics , the traditional competition remains to be preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical events , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to fill the fin@@ als at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the following year .
in order to reduce costs for the Organ@@ izer , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to absol@@ ve less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring banned items to the plane , find out a survey
a survey among air passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were smu@@ g@@ gled , among them at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they accidentally bore illegal knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they had been late discovered that they were mistakenly fed with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
by the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were m@@ illenni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent that were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent agreed to know@@ ingly carried items with blades through security screening , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it had sur@@ vey@@ ed travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled ware by airport security and how many would have done it inten@@ tional .
it is no surprise that people who are most smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most frequently flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about what liquid they are allowed to take , or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the biggest quantity of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .

&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to announce with the huge number of orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has so far failed to suggest that a portion of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less glossy number in announ@@ cing the latest quar@@ terly results : the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months Mus@@ k has frequently tou@@ red with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , the delivery of which has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age that Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models should be taken together - 500@@ ,000 , a million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are made every day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are too much delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ jects due to dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Head of the Environment Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that took place on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards of o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay adher@@ ence to a year to allow his authority to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly transgres@@ sed or ret@@ arded regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA ste@@ ward exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activists and others , and to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who dra@@ gged the EPA for over a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial procedures and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt , at some point , will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information are based . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a draft approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA to our claims is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York closed California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the prot@@ ru@@ ding smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts &apos;s surprising exchange of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the plat@@ former government to turn to environmental poll@@ utes and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Mountain Church , the old cemetery grounds in Tum@@ our will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc a concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martin@@ i emphas@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Württem@@ berg@@ ische Manu@@ faktur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ our and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to master Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wor@@ ding of the document , in addition to the former parish church , stood at the Tum@@ linger Berg in addition to the former parish church , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as evi@@ den@@ ced from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Ober@@ amt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the loc@@ ality of Tum@@ our , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the magnificent settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 under@@ line this historical situation .
the pat@@ ron@@ age law originated from the early medieval Church Law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest continued to be the owner of this church and was able to bequ@@ eath it to the church .
this involved the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the Bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two crushed on Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cast and the bell w@@ edges were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the chur@@ ch@@ ets and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ nants of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
the cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler until 18@@ 69 .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ i was abandoned .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half r@@ ushed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower , which is still existing today , was preserved as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ Chor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organis@@ er , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ arc invite the sixth seren@@ ade to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , 16th July , for the sixth seren@@ ade .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler University Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks the closing word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
to conclude the seren@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius line , which is of significance for tumours and hear@@ ers .

association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the Council of the Coun@@ cils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has prompted Coun@@ cill@@ or Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ amount &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decre@@ ed a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer ni@@ ette a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a formation fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval requirement is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer ni@@ et ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there@@ with , the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is prohibited under planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been made in the district of Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to consider the matter again .
however , they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re is planning to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ Wal@@ men@@ ah and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road was closed for hours .

city and retailers planning &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; in September , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the business association and the municipal administration plan to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city outside the usual grocery store .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is aimed not only on residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend , says Christian König .
the municipality and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means the commercial association and the city enter another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers like the first &quot; active day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest including sales so@@ ff@@ led on Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or opened up again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people lost sight of the city downtown when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to rein@@ vigor@@ ating the city centre - all the way to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
king in the spring said it was to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partially wi@@ dened .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that , for the first time , five Thür@@ inger cities will participate in the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action taking place under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry , and with many partners , also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour himself .

Tr@@ ump replaced Mexico after penet@@ rated tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump urged the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president accused him of publicly den@@ oun@@ cing the Wall . he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that trading for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ ch@@ p@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and contracted the Ford @-@ Bridge from Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and glan@@ ced at the wind@@ screen .
inside , the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged down by the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on 22nd July , is just a post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were syn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see her in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing the post @-@ job creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old con@@ gres@@ sman in Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
for him , the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want termination , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor puts a towel over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents , who received N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia made it possible for the first time to vote for the election campaign in the summer .
about the same time as the election , according to the FBI the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , fell down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she bore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they came away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fying the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene directed the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role would never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rell Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ ams H@@ ester and ur@@ ges him to be angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona returns the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out laughing .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; n --- he &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and precisely there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a dress of mour@@ ning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise to &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people swe@@ eps sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ des took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ch rope away and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona nar@@ rows two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks down with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta chat@@ ted about the placement with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feelings had left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is in some way inspir@@ ational because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled Wagner &apos;s Bay@@ reuth &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging against a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) can be used to show a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the Wall B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ stra@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine shri@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers pose as a rock@@ er@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that attracts itself through its &quot; ring &quot; staging .
the three Rhein@@ gold daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ ery Ha@@ gen surrounding the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Tree ) has to believe .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
stor@@ m@@ ily is celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Yan@@ ov@@ sky , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ orchester , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the high heat in casual leisure time .
Frank Cast@@ orf and his team were eag@@ erly awaited .
in 2013 , he had to let go of a g@@ lit@@ tering pipe concert , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the occasional &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is pleased about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year in several places .
where to go ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Fur@@ niture Fair , once a week I will be working here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
a lot : I did my gradu@@ ation school .
and then a study of civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off .
I realised for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different , working with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , as you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe , really .
and was it that way ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social welfare in the winter semester .
I will study concur@@ rent , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ s Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
is it different from a degree in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not a question of calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has other people &apos;s head , which have a different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you have to go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son sp@@ ends further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced chi@@ ef@@ ly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 points .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital of Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded , announced a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , the explosion happened on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the airport B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ Arabic is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed that they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering raising the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies , and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after K@@ ills
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , after which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it will show the agency &apos;s commitment to co @-@ operate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced the EPA &apos;s intention in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental defe@@ ats imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants to have a common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ bau decided to set up a common room in the future sen@@ iors residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property was signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time for the area belonging to the congregation to date , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for that .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the municipality .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering above such a common room as a meeting point only for the residents of sen@@ iors , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knit@@ ting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which has been decided by the provision of funds for the current household last autumn , will be made possible by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a community space would be beneficial , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw a b@@ ill@@ board between the legs , the statement that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding structure - would be possible as well as pitch roof - which reduces the drop@@ let height and makes the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the committee .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela Call points to the many own buildings that are not so easy to move forward , but now you lean from the window in the common room , she says : &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the community space - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , one does not give a grant , but receive a real exchange value which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ g &apos;s request to split the resolution accordingly finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes so : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we make the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st hur@@ ls on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police told us , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path from the Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den in the 82 @-@ year @-@ long run@@ way .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , travelling in the same direction , takes preced@@ ence over him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder himself drove on the street , he obviously did not care about the traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching ambul@@ ance .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from boxing against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
with human resources the FC Bavaria travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory event of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup for the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) the German football team Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti will have to do without David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical state and balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , that wasn &apos;t good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory game of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 fans , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking star to star in Har@@ z
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry cage St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be complemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star is more light than another , although it is far from far away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been running the highest astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail in the university town since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ aven@@ ue , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to dem@@ oted to the d@@ warf Plan@@ ets at the end@@ point - are set exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun , exactly 75 metres , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting pit battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ folded World Bo@@ xing Council light weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you going to champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas observed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand that .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes need this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to schedule a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also showed interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23rd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed himself openly to fight the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko insisted on the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four injured after punc@@ tures
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle just before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about one hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ises the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result as well , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the three chain should also be optimised further .
and a goal after a free ki@@ ck@@ off does not want to capture the run@@ es any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one stands next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain experience than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three chain at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ised and we do not afford so many play mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start after a draw , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know about that .
&quot; I evaluate the start of the season only after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be interrupted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland , as a light favorite on Sunday , go to the final meeting at the final ( almost ) final stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat at nine out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una &apos;s head coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ age evaluation tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Medic@@ ines Agency ( S@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were of age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in more than 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases &quot; suggest that the child was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she stated that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical grade evaluation , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they used to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very well in time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation @-@ needs bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule will be comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
the two other bridges lead through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , 10.@@ 60 metres long .
on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge cap on the north side .
this is a constra@@ int that is also used as an operating path .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to take place .
the special feature is that it is finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special t@@ act sensation .
because there is also a fiber cable , to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work , the residents were informed about the project by hand@@ outs .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ strasse and the gra@@ vey@@ ard in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three brid@@ ge@@ ways amount to € 700@@ ,000 .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the district of the volcano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green Party , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle to the poster &quot; Great campaign op@@ ener . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D people but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain Square , but now takes place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pe of the Af@@ D volcano Ei@@ fel reports that he tried to get such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ t there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : at 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ person Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one strikes the trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folk &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo trumpet player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both combines the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites itself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play mix into a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately went apart bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with each other seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d play it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never confused me or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially she suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but at school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the kids told me that I would look like a boy .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me being ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously announced a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t appro@@ ve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds that he owns coal mines in five states , and he inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would prevent us from working to make our country feel great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he reiter@@ ated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were gra@@ bbed with gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the re@@ porter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that it is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships on Friday in London , based on the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
a tragedy for soldiers fallen in Mali
during a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ischen Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two soldiers have thought about the fallen soldiers in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the still un@@ explained crash @-@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tech@@ no@@ isse@@ urs of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before the highest sacrifice performed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from North H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday .
at mid@@ day only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Defense Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mour@@ ning guests laid down roses , the relatives were in arms in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the staff captain took up the flying operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
even Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not waste the fall , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally attached to Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral Church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , and she said further in the message .
it is unclear where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also dis@@ covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prin@@ c@@ married &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
the last resting place of the 83 year @-@ old will be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for in the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always f@@ lown , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing with the Dan@@ es in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk st@@ umps instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco , and who had the reputation in this country to be the brand of critical intellectual intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising resignation of a Green Euro MPs from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its short one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen justified her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared in Hanover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to take place on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Parliament decides as soon as possible his self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the country day draws the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be judi@@ ci@@ ally checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we shall discuss all matters calm@@ ly if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the west@@ ward &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself pointed out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called on the stub@@ born de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has returned her country report , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the regional chairman Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision made by El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to conduct any debate in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Schulz , an SPD candidate for chan@@ cell@@ or , condem@@ ns the violation of El@@ ke &apos;s v@@ ests to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social @-@ Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the exit T@@ west costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her viol@@ ated vanity and her fru@@ stration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ates her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony uses this dirty in@@ filtration and tries to strike political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend to his MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career presents .
at that time the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the parliament day .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ s , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the German federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically impossible .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been shut down immediately and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concerns in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
as well as the manufacturers , the trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar level of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not transpor@@ table .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
do manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , production plants do not meet any immediate fault .
on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too little controllers in the case of seri@@ ousness .
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the commit to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be available are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ ism really necessary in case of food sandals ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and transport @-@ ready foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly so ou@@ tra@@ ged .
the imp@@ acted means are manufacturers , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all relevant authorities to inform the facts quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expenditure of European football clubs will not dis@@ rupt N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious champi@@ ons League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ Rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that at some point PS@@ G must prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to get the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must interact with legitimate sources of income enabling them to break the break even point in their activities related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini has dropped out of the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ courage excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will ampli@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , against The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sum total of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ship was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could result in payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Q@@ at@@ ari 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will be ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
previous sanctions against PS@@ G signi@@ fy that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to avoid the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with revenues of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the agreement .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s going away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s ultimate ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can take different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request from the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are tested every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ and @-@ white chocolate bars of 14 gram@@ mes distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants per year before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ der assess the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants make it to the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renov@@ ate the Treaty on the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for a comment .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g before the Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of co @-@ operation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate manufacturers .
customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli will be indul@@ ged in long @-@ haul flights in the business class nas@@ chen passengers scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i also distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time is short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for an appealing can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow up - nevertheless they created the im@@ possibility to win back the last part of the joke .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally gro@@ unded and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s mu@@ sta@@ che by &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ins@@ an@@ ity that could heat this fran@@ chise as a repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon meanwhile reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East versus West Ring @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ tuned Gregor and an ide@@ alistic idi@@ ot - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who we@@ ars a Re@@ agan @-@ mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are repeat@@ ed@@ ely visiting the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men , who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a hit against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
the officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has established const@@ ancy against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .
there was a lively exchange between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ mean Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the major effort on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four Palermo officials .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with close connection to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious false decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , draws attention to a media report on large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data registered there may result in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partially serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 ali@@ ens authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts has not been good until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data of 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , in statistics on sufficient persons , EU citizens are also included who wouldn &apos;t have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false orders resulted in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have entered the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF leads such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant continues to move to another EU country , this state can send him back to the rank and file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatened with illegal reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the assembly of the municipal council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingenious how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood to strangers , even un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their components .
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time corn makers reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach spring in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change into the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 performed blood donations .
half as many have booked Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ ver , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter shed about 500 milli@@ litres of their life @-@ juice each ten times .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation on a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a rein@@ forcing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 @-@ 2 to keep interest rates up to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members striving for an increase this month , as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but she sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to rein the inflation induced by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs would have had to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a portion of the mamm@@ oth economic package published a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper finance for banks as of the coming February , although it was said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on the real income of households continues to de@@ strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the interest rates , she reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphasized that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank for this and next year &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations for an increase in interest and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening will be worse at first , before it will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ comes policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote resulting in the fall of the spark .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed budgets , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % last month to 2.6 % in June although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the months ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceeding of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in Swa@@ p rates , mortgage markets are likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are clam@@ oring for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those who run out existing deals and fin@@ alise the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to waste the controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in the N@@ HS after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which has been taken before the intercourse , can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now comes from the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to fund the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year &apos;s ruling that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England head Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow people to register and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family physician can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex hospital .
the program will be signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence of how it is targeted , absorbed and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this major new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuous progress in tac@@ kling one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September on people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV can be left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country in order to protect individuals who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court home into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne patio - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex @-@ in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add the storage space and a mezzanine to make full use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the programme .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it look longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance there is space for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; we went in a bit of engineering , &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter @-@ important so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard into something amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate imperi@@ um
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of Vic@@ tori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate imperi@@ als worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business assets .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family established jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; principal operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in De LU@@ TI@@ S - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in made him leave with what I was holding for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed attempts , the Supreme Court hearing took place .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - which Col@@ in , as Paul says , have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of in@@ compet@@ ently administr@@ ating some of the possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading attor@@ neys , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood real estate where Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million when leaving the company , and Luke 26 million dollars was paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bit@@ tered by the conditions of their financial isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in , despite being a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO claims that the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met on his first day of work with senior employees , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House which he wanted to repair : poor information that would fall into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame junk by monitoring its media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was given fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to controlling Tr@@ ump Twitter habit is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a constant lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump Twitter habit ever was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officers know something we do not know - that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would have contained even more ignition material without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him out of trouble a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are constantly trying to present their own agenda by presenting dump material that may promote their views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ er to supply du@@ bi@@ ous information to the President for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone canc@@ eled a copy of an article of Got@@ WE@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began questioning employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to admini@@ ster and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police across Europe sends ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known naturally , hints from the population are hoped and requested .
Euro@@ pol announced on Friday the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar .
the experience had shown that many fle@@ ets hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
there have been 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ my wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website .
travelers hag@@ gle over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on a war foot , who have negotiated a gra@@ ven drawn by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field from their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire range &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants urged the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame for implementation , since it was useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local residents who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of those travelers just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them on as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour at the police , calling on 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenues were also paid by the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the District Church , the hotel building was offered to the Coun@@ cill@@ or Office as an accommodation unit , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be re@@ done in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause have already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are similar to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external systems are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Rap@@ port@@ eur wins the Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Rap@@ port@@ eur Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel took up work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with reference to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper rated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already first members of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time now to intervene in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand that acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ can in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more dr@@ umps of private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Off@@ er Tr@@ ump was personally located in the centre and under@@ lined the accus@@ ation whether the President could have imp@@ eded the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand Jury are therefore also called the Prosec@@ ution .
most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to take under oath .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ caster , invitations were already issued that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting had been asked for a statement , it was reported in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump Ad@@ visor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the implementation show that Mu@@ eller would not let himself in@@ timi@@ date in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on charging an indictment .
nevertheless , the suspension of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that expe@@ dite the work of the Special Rap@@ port@@ eur in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that I was not being as@@ cer@@ tained against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no reason to believe that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting repro@@ aches against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material for the Special Rap@@ port@@ eur and its employees .
that triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday that the Special Rap@@ port@@ eur could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ cti@@ ca a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has settled by the seven @-@ times size of Berlin from the shelf .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the large Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is driving north and probably will need two or three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the canc@@ elling of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear as far as research is concerned .
but altogether there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now demoli@@ shed col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this shelf was the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking down a few years ago .
a complete Shel@@ f is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen C shelf is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is now .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice flo@@ ats as much water as it makes after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is aware of , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest withdrawal ever since the beginning of the recordings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these scientists do not lead to the erosion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many ice @-@ hits of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in the past decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic extends towards South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature has also contributed to this decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus t@@ amed up to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants house tari@@ ff at staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls for the employer to step out of the employers &quot; association in order to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ an Day broke through 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have completed their first working day .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
there were around 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wishes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demands for skilled personnel , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education campaign , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age due to the service .
highest time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Daniel@@ s , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had already taken care of a bad surprise in the day of the working day , when he publicly questioned the cap of staff and the other parties were amazed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want all the possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration should seek a common tari@@ ff with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level oriented to career years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO @-@ migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
Italy has warned that NGOs who use ba@@ il@@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they must not continue this unless they do not comply with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to express itself in detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes rubber boats on board , which are supplied to them by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go down so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was alleged to have been only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGO &apos;s involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; to their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there was always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , a look@@ out point on the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flying &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga mani@@ f@@ ests itself for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in future instead of being black@@ ened by wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ des included .
this has also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that there are several clubs coming up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London will host the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract one could be more often present on these markets online , than just once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or football @-@ simulation FIFA are being challenged at competition level .
as in normal sports , long ago , le@@ agues have established themselves in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the 2022 season , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is this really a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which can be found in classic sports , such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical insight and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and respect the nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are internationally on the road , which is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
it is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants write .
many countries are already on the agenda .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as an instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
according to D@@ utt , the soccer league football clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Director R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the eggs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the egg alternatives for cooking and baking &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal of pois@@ oned eggs .
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and all the eggs were taken out of sale throughout Germany .
in the regi@@ ments , only eggs are supposed to be taken , which demon@@ stra@@ bly contain no fi@@ pron@@ il .
Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy on Thursday said at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ looking eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos; mother Lyn@@ n Roy saying that there is &quot; no day in which I do not pi@@ erce the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I turn around with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the realization that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or that she would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , jump out of a building , get up , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that it should benefit from the fall by some press .

Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua K@@ Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern has a big season with the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation will not hurt there .
something else was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er to see , he made the rush to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the objection could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C of Naples .
but the sign of the coach could indicate Kim@@ me too .
not the eight @-@ year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f who was born out of childhood , de@@ but@@ ant and just from the holiday .
sugar is best distributed to those who want to drink a lot that you want to keep in a good mood .
those who were chosen to inher@@ it the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ ber@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was running as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right in the back , this is his position , the white band@@ age on her arm did her rest .
and Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can best take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the cast trou@@ pe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were engaged in himself .
V@@ idal hopes to over@@ play his missing fitness ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out of the achievements of the Asia @-@ Travel ( collap@@ sed also condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not neg@@ atively fall into their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked out quite well .
Sü@@ le was running along with Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm took a lot of difficulty , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in building the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game relo@@ cation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ er , one looked at the game afterwards .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ í said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least he does not have to teach the new one more .

company content with Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) , is in office .
chambers and companies in the region refer to T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , chairman of the association Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing interfer@@ es with the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest about @-@ face is of course in infrastructure policy : the gap closure of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the Ministry hopes that the planning process will continue this year , until 2021 should be the right to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to put the track in operation in December 2020 , says Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann , head of the ministry .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as von Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , kno@@ bs have an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the Chamber of Commerce also pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
provided is a premium of 1000 Euros for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros , if graduates become independent within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Trier , said that the planned road construction would be quick to establish facts .
until now , 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the country &apos;s mobility .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U faction vice @-@ president , refers to calculations performed by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 for the preservation of country roads as proposed .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of directors of wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreements .
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the chairman of the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases that are ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles is also taking place , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from shipping and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after acc@@ using the authorities of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if on Saturday the Is@@ ar draws again , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is meant to shar@@ pen the wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally responsible behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an also records with 85 and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he became a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ul@@ atory cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters rom@@ p in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day .
through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , stuffed animals and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to dis@@ semin@@ ate worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack of thousands as a opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in 3D film , which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without word .
the Lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing large headaches .
Dr. Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert from the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that tran@@ sm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ch@@ ins , and in very dry weather , there are a lot of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse has said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions taken into account include better water distribution and evap@@ oration of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the small town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year .
Fes@@ th@@ öh@@ le &apos;s point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to bring their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings range .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or the car@@ tels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts displaying his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der federal prosec@@ utor has been established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the committee for the protection of journalists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year , journalists are rarely tried by the kill@@ ers .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ as they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally and even though the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an province capital .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and shot him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have upset the sons , assumed gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake lay in forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper publishing the same story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues believed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for North America in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ to @-@ do examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in prosec@@ uting the Mexican drug history , wherever she led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take on the task that you are acc@@ using as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ us team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells incorrect , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing has happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space in which the Staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly allowed . days earlier , it was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the Gover@@ nor designated as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has shown three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to government spending focused on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealers and government authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian belonging to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office has been dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few notes and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is thei@@ rs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists in the whole country have become more ph@@ one@@ tic by re@@ writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in organized protests and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez was accused by the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
she has since requested that she be re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book entitled &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as car@@ tel : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and a head@@ phone were lying next to her detached head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tels with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .

researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian clim@@ ber were so well maintained that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find out that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has ast@@ o@@ unded researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a walking shell , is probably threatened by eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ defense , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed itself to be better mixed into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mar@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life , including his con@@ served performer to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but is preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chal@@ k season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k season was a time when giant ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through western Canada until an over@@ flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is so &apos; rare as a win in Lot@@ to &apos; .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates bearing the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread to the top .
I can count the scales at his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
a violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles @-@ long St@@ out - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) approximately 20 people were injured on the late afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first data of the police , around 17.@@ 00 hrs between the jun@@ ks of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other .
at first there were no information about the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of mild to moderate trau@@ mas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large offer of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the direction of Munich , there was a ten kilometer long back @-@ sta@@ u .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also on the back road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the characteristics of the vehicle len@@ ders , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment almost everyone has experienced it : nothing susp@@ end is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a genius idea .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes up an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by using a mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ activate the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many more remote routes in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the train card de@@ valuation without a conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient way of booking a ticket anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one goes into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will then appear among the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
if the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at square Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is meant to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Managing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because of@@ ten@@ times one has , in any case , one of the co @-@ travelers not all the documents required for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to instruc@@ t .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to poor tuning in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and taking the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on their feed , closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ gi@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was twe@@ eting the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos from the police band and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his rif@@ le and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt shaken .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock she picked up her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of people &apos;s point of view who live in commun@@ ion and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who wore a flo@@ wery dress and a fitting crown , the two had a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black condition many times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember what I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be drawn up there .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience , in which she personally experiences no bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police department , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business@@ man who had lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell figure .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food @-@ righteousness and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rell to mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together , along with six other natives he followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team . &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed , because I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ite &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ite &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions supported the movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really uph@@ eld by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , F@@ erg@@ uson news cameras have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still she cl@@ ings to a chant and feels bound to this memory ever since she went into F@@ erg@@ uson three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson to the street .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been split@@ ting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hardly leaves the topic any . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be real class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole showcase ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city , as well as the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then ble@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the Far@@ mers Market Hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work it will be concluded .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been shopping for almost a week in the farmer &apos;s market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady again and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this might not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that &apos;s unnecessary .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall intact .
after all the goods offered there is fresh , is largely offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are hired only by larger companies in a shopping centre , because the renting of these shops is often not acceptable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall go down during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes .
or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all the stores from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping centre that is empty .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but there is no room for a farmer &apos;s market thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
if the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st for@@ fei@@ ted a 35 @-@ year sentence after publicly campaig@@ ning for secret diplom@@ ats about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( a fitting simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ lady and a tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry .
by algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment , not only for the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black and white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette stu@@ bs and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a type of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of DNA .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal spectac@@ les , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic strip illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama would indeed only demand a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of successful meeting .
there are also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump introduces a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid sp@@ li@@ ts that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called for an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with me is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand from the United States &quot; disciplinary teams , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cool , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never let your mouth shut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at the University of Oxford wanted to kill
a nationwide human chase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were searched as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , arrest warran@@ ts were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ a ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 La@@ a has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ lah , vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that he was now in a be@@ wil@@ der@@ ment and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair examined by the relevant authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College stated in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate it strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip who said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were both them and War@@ ren in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed on the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in conversation with the Russian point of sale r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA by the conduct of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
after a visit to the Moscow headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA , General Director , Olivier Nig@@ gli , declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
these were shared by the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be assumed any adverse health impair@@ ment , it was reported in the announcement .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been shown to have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ oun @-@ containing anti @-@ cau@@ ter@@ us .
Al@@ di wants to establish clarity and transparency in his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
the answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer specific groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low compliance results - so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of anno@@ y@@ ances in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ scent , the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ scent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ scent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line where employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ scent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that handles its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ scent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company Con@@ ver@@ scent deplo@@ ys , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice - are identified and addressed quicker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty washing going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ scent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors supporting both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ scent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
g@@ lit@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only possible .
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ scent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are going well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee commitment according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can dem@@ oti@@ fy dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was by speed of decision making and the quality of communication capable of re@@ organizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will gain new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bro@@ o@@ ds
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus .
some with@@ drew their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these odd minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the water man football center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said brother trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood has postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six seasons in West wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to last 18 exercises during the month of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the rules change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on her for three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel belonging to the elevated class , which has already been abandoned with foot@@ balls that cleared a protective grid behind a door post , will not be an easy task .
bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to recording an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t care too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fac@@ tants and then view their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tants that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan for which social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts screening will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tants are challenged by third parties , people want more contex@@ ts to make informed choices about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continued to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ ric Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb im@@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time one kind@@ led a fire on account of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were even there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; ) this seems to be too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that centuries had spent in the tren@@ ches .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke to landscape painters , gardening , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing what had : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , whom the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a for@@ eigner , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell hus@@ bands solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying up rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ ins . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday with the inaugur@@ ation of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf .
even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team intend to keep the logo and the slogan secret for Nelson Ar@@ tz .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the campaign yesterday on posters at the Rhine @-@ based chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website that was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we believe that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in action , it &apos;s about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s called further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an omni@@ potent promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they are competing with other communities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will pay a mid @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises in Ankara on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week as well .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Navy were dismissed .
since the coup failed , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the pulling attempt of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ com@@ bat@@ ants in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abolition of the ban on the ban on female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the large rein@@ for@@ ce@@ in of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed another 73@@ 95 state servants per decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least with reference to the reform directives of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is purpos@@ efully driving the Islam@@ isation of the Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not let Nato go cold .
in any case , in the Alliance , there are doubts about the readiness to deploy the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changing the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent in other countries green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge which will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ e route for road pav@@ ement shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the platform shuttle has been cont@@ ested over the past few months - now it is expected to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ ten track on which the tourist train is going to be built is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the platform shuttle in the long term , construction work on the route will begin in this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to order and rehabili@@ tate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; declared Minister of Transport , Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country is over 75 percent .
the contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian Rail@@ ways as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the racing bike shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a rail link that is popular for tourists between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is being used by a large number of people to order them again in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just when you thought it might not be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are reached by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot accordingly to his convi@@ ctions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that a Step@@ ford woman would look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - last but not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female qualities that acc@@ ru@@ e to rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , quiet one of the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they remain tent@@ atively at the edge of consumer culture .
but what is se@@ eping through the zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots show up in a time where the rights of women are threatened world @-@ wide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most striking aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the open eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing indicating independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the 2017 speech : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a tru@@ ism of the dump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small formats .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice in the United States about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump choosing relative .
we are all going to strain ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of b@@ umps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship which they had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and plat@@ former , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his kit@@ tens of one day will no longer be rep@@ elled .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the Right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as a notion of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact one as very mild crimes occur .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the cli@@ mati@@ sing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ics Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go to it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olog@@ ising , while I was tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of re@@ ap@@ ers , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to the first death of the dead .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority has said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Flo@@ wers schools , the four @-@ wat@@ chers were released from F@@ ingers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen during their holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
as a symbol for the release , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young Eagle that grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this the m@@ lower band introduced a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it hat@@ ched by his chickens .
instead of a chicken hut a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle wi@@ ped out his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed a chicken co@@ z three and four in the rehear@@ s@@ als of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln that bore cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ day @-@ vessel that he was accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues , former head of school Michael Müller , who always jumps to teaching bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the ch@@ ick time is over now , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she only leaves her students very ung@@ o@@ dly , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ wat@@ cher .
at the end all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ class users have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television , announced .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal camp@@ ground people were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars in the emissions categories Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fit .
how and when will customers receive updates about updates ?
manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but has not yet been called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is already due anyway , it will be completed within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the conver@@ sions go ?
&quot; it &apos;s hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it can be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE tells us to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would consult , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat to a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but just in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions threaten .
so far there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE tells to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner Le@@ ar , who has been introduced with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she would use Tr@@ ump to make clear her vision .
the Kennedy Center named after the former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the previous prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s City Engineer , is going to reti@@ re next year .
the place has already been written out - but suitable applicants are rare .
for the past 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city builder .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he teaches in the press talk .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application will fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the earliest possible date .
in such a way , in compliance with the regular notice of notice , there is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a lower civil servant for the administrative community , the applicant must present corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill it out any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the clos@@ eness to the citizens is the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the chi@@ pper with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the amt and his employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ modelling of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Down@@ ho@@ fen parking space are about to be initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will book at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city builder of great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening workshop , many things can be re@@ acted very flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the out@@ going city architect .
anyway , the city architect has a high level of responsibility .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end , everything goes over my table . &quot;
when taking care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with him for ten years , Manfred Beau@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stayed with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , anyone who wants to bury Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building and construction planning law .
the Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil engineering and civil engineering , construction management , under@@ growth , administration of municipal property , Municipal operating courtyard with building yard and urban gar@@ den@@ ers , as well as under the Civil Protection Agency , including Monument Protection .
bike thrown on lines : southern railway track locked
according to the police , the unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track bridge in the area of the Le@@ oben Road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
close to the crime scene , witnesses saw a ro@@ ar sco@@ oter and a bike rider watched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a realm of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong@@ do@@ ers would have put themselves in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delays to delays and costs for rail transport , pat@@ rons of rail customers may also come to the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south route could be led without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were open on Friday morning , two of them were concerned about the long distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and in Britain 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .
while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food cannot penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are ev@@ ened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium leads too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell in mice carries a certain bacter@@ ium in its ent@@ rails .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and a diet tolerant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was kept separate , had not had this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial properties of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were created by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria found themselves on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed towards the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active ingredient was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. Cru@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira are mar@@ ching at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes of what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho desired three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and retired in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already used such advertising in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new deep fence for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still was the SPD leader , social @-@ demo@@ crat prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
the most important desire of the election fighters was not merely a fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the League .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House staff closely watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were failures .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal @-@ CD@@ U looks at a general signal against the co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Euro MP Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party , Michael Kell@@ ner , called for the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ated Dutch Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
El@@ ke T@@ westen still needs to return their mandate , &quot; said the German managing director and campaig@@ ner of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD electoral champion sigh@@ s when the new job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U after the arrival of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen there without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary apo@@ gee of a whole series of big and minor crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the misery began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a blue eye , not more , the comrades at that time cal@@ med down .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a pi@@ geon , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
in the weeks after the com@@ rade had lab@@ ori@@ ously strug@@ gled again .
then , when they hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication he made almost everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
in view of the VW @-@ gas @-@ aff@@ aires and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised for a long time .
survey results were added .
despite this , or perhaps precisely for that reason , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the covenant in recent weeks .
the desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is no fault with the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anist T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ west puts her own career starter on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , leader of the party lef@@ tist party in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but by the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , leaving Lower Saxony &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been any more or there have been further commitments made by the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
subsi@@ dy for town core III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development moved into emotion on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on what was previously happened .
since 1991 , there have been san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , and not only to open up new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , we received the information from the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest from the community .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned territory there is interest in rehabili@@ t@@ ating .
if necessary , the area limits could then also post@@ p@@ one again .
the jet@@ ty represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the restructuring area would eventually be set as a by@@ word .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out once , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the stat@@ ute decision should take place as soon as possible , so that the renovation can begin next year .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations .
it is a question of assessing urban@@ istic mis@@ understand@@ ings and deciding when it is to be rehabili@@ t@@ ated and to what extent .
there will be a remedi@@ ation remark in the basic book for the respective plot .
once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to his own feelings and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel pointed out that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which , among other things , it concerns the structural condition and the renovation intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget@@ ary and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; questionnaire , data on size , division and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphasized that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - those who come first , first grin@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; City Centre II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the participants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to get home and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed Z@@ 4 technology both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of advertising of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn event for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military provided to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials from the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
a helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire engine and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft .
the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , until the law@@ ns were cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note also adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security staff of the unit stayed on the plane during the time on the plane .
the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME did not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal government to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was referred to by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform which was in progress in the Senate and he advoc@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government provisions .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for political reasons .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump launched an investigation in February when the presidential jet landed in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports describing the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to dep@@ ose the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ffs of the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virg@@ ina .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract signing .
at that time , the ex press spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss a tricky job
&quot; &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ ading runner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Second World Tennis League comes to the stand@@ ings in the stand@@ ings in the stand@@ ings in the stand@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss is ki@@ cked off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel in the stand@@ ings @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second World League has given the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the post@@ erior positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are mainly concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ zi@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the far north is practical .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , who is playing at the tournament in the Czech Republic of Bi@@ ella , does not succeed in this season .

after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move back to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay will fill the ca@@ der .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress poured a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors from O@@ MV , together with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed with the construction of North Stream 2 in Russia .
the dr@@ one is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions by executive order .
there are twelve weapons available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could refuse and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city once again organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
the watch is turned back in the city day@@ care centers .
on September 1 the town of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is kept out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh coffee .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past put@@ ty year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need grows continuously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for by 45 hours of the week , eat in the ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers have kitchen service from 1 September . they heat the meals delivered , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , fill out the meal , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - determines the ho@@ ur@@ ly rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that has turned out to be the most economical in comparison to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance .
and that even though 46 partial @-@ time employees are recru@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all the members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women advocate the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible when women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters .

two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the police information , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who was holding his friends on Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 o &apos;clock , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to grab the girl &apos;s cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed .
without a prey the duo was fle@@ eing .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern over investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow in the case of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ a site .
more than 500 people work in the plant , which besides other products manufacture Hob@@ s@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ per &apos;s owner Pla@@ in said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; express concern that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot provide clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production down@@ turn , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ in said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will react directly to the fact that we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with our employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross facility , especially in production lines and operative improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t let N@@ ey@@ mar follow after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paying professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since he arrived from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned by the president of the PS@@ G three years ago ?
when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti &apos;s PS@@ G medium @-@ field player at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ rator had intentionally over@@ turned a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and so on the cl@@ adding of the vehicle repaired material damage of more than 200 euros .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for instructions .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car hit him in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dge and tou@@ red the guard .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , he met a passenger car in his lane , so he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console .
the car was damaged by material damage .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of the victims is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ out , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication of the German Press Agency , he anticipated by former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful for the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then mis@@ conception of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence among the cats is measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the infrin@@ gements in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , it is striking that the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ g@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ our@@ ing food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a completely normal pedago@@ gical tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote the mem@@ o@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take shelter from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he analyses the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report presented by Mr. Ulrich Weber from the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 dom@@ ed cats .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
especially when emotion@@ ality is concerned , the punishment for the students could be even more intense .
nevertheless , in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , many victims inv@@ ari@@ ably appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories linked to him in numerous cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ise at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a cathedral sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to acc@@ use him , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um on which he worked was perceived by virtually all those sur@@ vey@@ ed as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
this is how the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , presents an excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and candy , and &quot; always moved from grapes to children . &quot;
only a minority acqu@@ ires about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which has already led to breach of rage .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just squ@@ at with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also gave ear @-@ cow@@ ries and moved too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his ret@@ ali@@ ation , however , it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time , the 1960s and the 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you know even such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the ex@@ propri@@ ation of violence in the pre @-@ school , these are dre@@ gs of dre@@ d@@ ging .
one wonders whether it is not more familiar with its fame and role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media r@@ ushed to him .
in the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still ze@@ al@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot has been reported in connection with the report about mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some involvement or co @-@ existence in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : definitely no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault con@@ tends to have entrusted itself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; said an affected deputy for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims of shame remain silent .
if they did not even commit themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , it would certainly not be a conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the cats and cats rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student phr@@ ased it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insight and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rator .
I think it is absurd to assume that it is just ridi@@ culous to assume that ... Bu@@ bes have opened up more or more clearly or more clearly or rather than against their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed during the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , so Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any co @-@ existence .
likewise , he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an ad@@ vert .
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot was read about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forci@@ ble exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this again is a mis@@ use of the report .
there it is ne@@ atly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the dom@@ ed cats , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let &apos;s say , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral manager of the cathedral @-@ cats .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ assed and mal@@ igned , and suffered from them , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz college .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims inv@@ ari@@ ably rated the overall humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories link with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is , at most , the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
but despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently set his ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the risk of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when audit pen@@ alties were long forbidden in Bavaria .
before that , they were in a legal grey zone , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the victims might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit has actually been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
it was only in 1980 that the punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating past moral standards .
the princess is right there .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what was scor@@ ched in the pre @-@ school against ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus sla@@ ying ear @-@ arrows and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when corpor@@ al punishment was forbidden , he strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger described in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of test punishment also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , as the dom@@ ed cats only played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I was by no means saying that he was carrying a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and sweets on its own , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys are no big singers and they stand before each success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep faith and warm @-@ hearted man , from which one can not imagine that he could only do a fly a little .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former dom@@ ed cats today , 23 years after his em@@ ination , visit him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ ed cats are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person to whom they still look up today and whom they almost rever@@ e .
and please , once again quite clearly : all that is accused of are education methods which were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , all too obvious .
because the report that was just published reli@@ eves him .
now it would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
