<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former land of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map Munich promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but that is why it is very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork, which one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, detailed maps, so-called original compositions, were incorporated into towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were based on figures from the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying business." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was produced, i.e. in 1877 when the Munich suburb was incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: at the zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered flurpieces from the so-called "urine" from which the base tax was deduced.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "little parcels now show no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the site of the October festival since 1810, actually was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street names" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district-asylum-institute" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden undertook the establishment - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the Ankle of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he also prohibited the personnel to resort to violence against the occupants," "" "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">There was room for 280 patients, and more than 500 seats were added later.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk rending facility in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former prison.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected in the architectural style of the original building of the asylum, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the shopping street called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were preceded by the preparations and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-up.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens' rights group publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Fares has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," "" "it says in the statement of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri Law, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as prosecuting authorities of the state that disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to issue a warning message, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will stop 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "stated Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring some deposit money or let the relatives know they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report set by the FBI, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws, obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have implemented the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidejured-Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The members of the CDU, Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac, have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"" "representatives of the" "" "Fischbacher CDU" "" "together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the" "" "Rechtgrabenhof" "" "of the Schwendemann family." ""</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates in five apartments holiday palaces.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäeste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV President of Fisherman, he called the" "" "crossover project" "" "as" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot generate profitably on such steep areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much needed to be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "Schwendemann stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not lead to organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the Leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they can continue their business," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers are often criticised for the promotion." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence promotion.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-air area therefore amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost amounting to 71 500 Euros, one half was supported by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="87">The farmers therefore remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence magic.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the durability of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landladies it is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also stated:" "" "here the best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape conservation directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of willow fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to disclose the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be encumbered must not be hardy (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 fishing relay project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 11,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firon's square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals of the president for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue herself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty immobilizers would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he resorted to its significance, and especially the meaning that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta stated, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's vibrating words, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a classical visual presentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early Neoconservatives that will bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch will not give light on the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to lighten the road, but ignite hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black dresses Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her captain speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-distance runner Muir carries on this road and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in 1500 m and 5,000 m of runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who was supposed to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The crew captain says that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be mixed with the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all the Scotts that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the overheating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to strike him for anything, from home politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum classified as official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Mr Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just true people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profiting.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to the Catholic faith in Hogans.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's employees referred to as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA chief Pruitt rejects due to delaying the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Head of the Environment Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of Smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a period that took place on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards of ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt announced in June that he would delay adherence to a year to allow his authority to study the plan and avoid" "" "interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly transgressed or retarded regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA steward exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activists and others, and to set the deadline for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who dragged the EPA for over a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial procedures and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and authority that gives us serious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">However, the EPA statement said that Pruitt, at some point, will use his "authority to delay and all other legally available full powers" to ensure that the provisions "on a solid policy and the best available information are based."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">"" "" "" "a draft approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years." ""</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Mountain Church, the old cemetery grounds in Tumour will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="471">"" "in 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the" "" "Württembergische Manufaktur."

<seg id="474">As evidenced from the description of the Freudenstadt Oberamt of 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible in the locality of Tumour, the "Berg" is the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 underline this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage law originated from the early medieval Church Law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest continued to be the owner of this church and was able to bequeath it to the church.</seg>

<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Larger of the two crushed on Christmas in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cast and the bell wedges were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the churchets and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">The cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler until 1869.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hilariusi was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower, which is still existing today, was preserved as a witness of the 750 year old church history.</seg>

<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in Steinfurt in the Furniture Fair, once a week I will be working here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at the school in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.</seg>

<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">A lot: I did my graduation school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a study of civil engineering, let's say, successfully broke off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realised for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different, working with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, there is an insight, as you can see how it is on site, at the focal point maybe, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it that way?</seg>

<seg id="918">This is a constraint that is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special feature is that it is finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires a special tact sensation.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fiber cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">In the run-up to the work, the residents were informed about the project by handouts.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play-Rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that at some point PSG must prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to get the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the energy-rich family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must interact with legitimate sources of income enabling them to break the break even point in their activities related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "during the current three-year FFP period that runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has dropped out of the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will amplify the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum total of EUR 44.4 million can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $82 million), which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could result in payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatari 2022 have argued that Neymar will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Previous sanctions against PSG signify that UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to avoid the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymars transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with revenues of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars going away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1159">In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolates for Swiss.</seg>

<seg id="1161">Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants make it to the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renovate the Treaty on the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros's daughter.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like the time is short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"" "" "" "first Day of Camp" "" "functioned surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for an appealing can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1188">By focusing on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - nevertheless they created the impossibility to win back the last part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally grounded and his parody goes more to the watering can principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-vicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good good impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's mustache by "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random insanity that could heat this franchise as a repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon meanwhile reminds of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its East versus West Ring-Ikonography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-tuned Gregor and an idealistic idiot - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan-mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Comrade Detective, who was edited on a smaller length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef are repeatedely visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men, who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make everything a forage for a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Impact against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police is a hit against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">The officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the case of the same raids in Italy, two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of over 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, violent acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has established constancy against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court home into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne patio - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex-in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add the storage space and a mezzanine to make full use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage serge Mouille lighting set the style for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there is space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"we went in a bit of engineering," Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counter-important so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the floor - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they succeeded in enlarging the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard into something amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate imperium</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of Victorias's largest real estate imperials worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business assets.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place at the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family established jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retailers.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "principal operator and the dominating personality" in De LUTIS - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin made him leave with what I was holding for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in an initial Affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed attempts, the Supreme Court hearing took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control over the existing business - which Colin, as Paul says, have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently administrating some of the possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance states that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood real estate where Colin opened the first denim shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group, with Colin claims that Mark had paid $10 million when leaving the company, and Luke 26 million dollars was paid.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were, Paul says," "" "bittered by the conditions of their financial isolation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin, despite being a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin responded by SMS, to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case is in front of the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO claims that the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met on his first day of work with senior employees, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House which he wanted to repair: poor information that would fall into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame junk by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was given fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said the former electoral campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to controlling Trump Twitter habit is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a constant lobbying." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trump Twitter habit ever was" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officers know something we do not know - that Trump Tweets would have contained even more ignition material without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to present their own agenda by presenting dump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the adviser to supply dubious information to the President for strategic reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he stiffens to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone canceled a copy of an article of GotWE.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has uttered false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to administer and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenues were also paid by the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the District Church, the hotel building was offered to the Councillor Office as an accommodation unit, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not disputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Rapporteur wins the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Rapporteur Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the panel took up work in recent weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "" "" with reference to people familiar with the matter. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper rated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first members of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time now to intervene in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trump campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"" "" "" "in the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand that acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign." ""</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more drumps of private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the Special Offer Trump was personally located in the centre and underlined the accusation whether the President could have impeded the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury are therefore also called the Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite people to take under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN broadcaster, invitations were already issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting had been asked for a statement, it was reported in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trump Advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election chief Paul Manafort were in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the implementation show that Mueller would not let himself intimidate in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on charging an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the suspension of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the subject gives the democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good" "", "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any measures that expedite the work of the Special Rapporteur in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey told three times that I was not being ascertained against the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to believe that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rooting reproaches against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material for the Special Rapporteur and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That triggered speculations about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urging of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The large Koloss, weighing over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometres, is driving north and probably will need two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the cancelling of the iceberg is unclear as far as research is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="1525">But altogether there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now demolished colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shelf was the balance of waxing and breaking down a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Shelf is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen C shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice floats as much water as it makes after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen C Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is aware of, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest withdrawal ever since the beginning of the recordings," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these scientists do not lead to the erosion of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many ice-hits of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature has also contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus tamed up to the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants house tariff at staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU calls for the employer to step out of the employers "association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the Cretan Day broke through 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have completed their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were around 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">"" "" "" "the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "after the parties" "" "wishes" "", "the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term demands for skilled personnel, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education campaign, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a veritable" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This results in a high number of employees who excrete disease or age due to the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Highest time for action so that not even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Daniels, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had already taken care of a bad surprise in the day of the working day, when he publicly questioned the cap of staff and the other parties were amazed.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "peoples want all the possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should seek a common tariff with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county-affiliated cities," "" "says peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">So the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level oriented to career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone of NGO-migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned that NGOs who use bailboats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they must not continue this unless they do not comply with new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation only for one year, refused to express itself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the rescue of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "" "said the organization in an opinion on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge any accusations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes rubber boats on board, which are supplied to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can go down so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was alleged to have been only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGO's involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring any "essential changes or obstructions" to their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Anstiege and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "nine Weilermer Biker, the" "" "Berlin outpost" "" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy trials and sights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there was always longer ascents, for the long trials reward.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, a lookout point on the lookout point, connected by "flying" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had become acquainted with the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga manifests itself for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in future instead of being blackened by wind and weather over stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gades included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">"" "he is sure that there are several clubs coming up on this train." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London will host the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must be dealt with in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-sportsmen under contract one could be more often present on these markets online, than just once a year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or football-simulation FIFA are being challenged at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, long ago, leagues have established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the 2022 season, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is this really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobatic has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses, which can be found in classic sports, such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical insight and a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and respect the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but she also sees problems:" "" "doping becomes more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are internationally on the road, which is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interaktive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">It is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte consultants write.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot to do in Europe as well.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as an instructional subject, says Frobatic.</seg>
<seg id="1651">According to Dutt, the soccer league football clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison," explains VfB Director Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1653">Just falling into nostalgia and clearing the old times is no longer enough today.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company with the modern market at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," he says.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case appears to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, jump out of a building, get up, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>

<seg id="1726">It was often irreconcilable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>

<seg id="1750">Audi to change 850.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction</seg>
<seg id="1751">One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The chairman of the BMW Group said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutralizing the exhaust gases that are ejected from diesel vehicles is also taking place, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plotting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">Companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after accusing the authorities of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing large headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Dr. Eric Chaisse, an expert from the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring brought much less rain and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cichins, and in very dry weather, there are a lot of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse has said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weak.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">Solutions taken into account include better water distribution and evaporation of evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to bring their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings range.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while in the whole country the corpses accumulate, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts displaying his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder federal prosecutor has been established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the committee for the protection of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists are rarely tried by the killers.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodocias they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are intrinsically and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everybody." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan province capital.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and shot him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have upset the sons, assumed gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake lay in forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper publishing the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">"" "" "" "Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues believed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for North America in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug dowry problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper deserved a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-to-do examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug history, wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to live on," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodocius team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells incorrect, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said," "" "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing has happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous blend of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space in which the Staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly allowed. days earlier, it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the Governor designated as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has shown three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to government spending focused on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealers and government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The Valdez office has been dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few notes and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "journalists in the whole country have become more phonetic by rewriting" "" "SOS Press" "" "in organized protests and buildings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez was accused by the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since requested that she be re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and a valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book entitled "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a walking shell, is probably threatened by eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-defense, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed itself to be better mixed into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>

<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta marmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life, including his conserved performer to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chalk season." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk season was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through western Canada until an overflooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is so 'rare as a win in Lotto'.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Clogged remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates bearing the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread to the top.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) approximately 20 people were injured on the late afternoon at a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, around 17.00 hrs between the junks of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg), nearly 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first there were no information about the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "it is a matter of mild to moderate traumas," "" "said a police spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large offer of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment almost everyone has experienced it: nothing suspend is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a genius idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffalo.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor comes and wakes up an unsuspecting or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by using a mobile phone that you take your seat and deactivate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test run runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it will probably be available at many more remote routes in Germany early next year," "" "said a railway spokesman." ""</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of booking a ticket anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: one goes into the train, calls his ticket to" "" "My Tickets." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for the electronic devaluation will then appear among the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at square Y, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is meant to take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train attendant, simply check out the DB Navigator yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"" "this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," "" "says Michael Peterson, Managing Director of DB Fernverkehr." ""</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes one has, in any case, one of the co-travelers not all the documents required for devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to instruct.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor tuning in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and taking the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further access numbers on the same route are not unlocked yet.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since nobody else posted the information on their feed, closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retwegied on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "thought Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets on people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people shouting, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman said his rifle and cried:" "" "I will kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "it's not usual," "" "said Ferrell to her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt shaken.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11 o'clock she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of people's point of view who live in communion and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flowery dress and a fitting crown, the two had a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black condition many times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember what I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she recalled what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I could not take her away," "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up there.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience, in which she personally experiences no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell figure.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food-righteousness and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came Ferrell to mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that profited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt mates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer together, along with six other natives he followed the Whose Streets team. "in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we're talking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, because I shall be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community coming together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of Whose Streets show "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrite's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt naked," "" "said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrite's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, who after the murder of the black teenager, Trayvon Martin have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions supported the movement," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black gay women must bear the brunt of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really upheld by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action" "" "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, Ferguson news cameras have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"" "she describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home:" "" "a mess." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">Still she clings to a chant and feels bound to this memory ever since she went into Ferguson three years ago in Ferguson to the street.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">"" "from" "" "dream" "" "to" "" "megalomania" "" ": TV readers discuss bit-gallery" ""</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"" "" "" "cold" "" "hardly leaves the topic any." ""</seg>

<seg id="2094">While advocates build that a gallery is attracting more customers into the city, as well as the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the Farmers Market Hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work it will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall intact.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all the goods offered there is fresh, is largely offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But there is no room for a farmer's market thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst forfeited a 35-year sentence after publicly campaigning for secret diplomats about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 called A Becoming Stresemblance (a fitting similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a translady and a trailblazing dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">By algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment, not only for the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black and white Selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette stubs and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a type of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of DNA.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal spectacles, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic strip illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama would indeed only demand a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of successful meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweetable ways to keep the rigid splits that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning called for an end of "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with me is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in his hand from the United States "disciplinary teams, such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacras, which assemble like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2160">On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Laa (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the scene, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007 Laa has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cublah, vice-president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that he was now in a bewilderment and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal affair examined by the relevant authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "" "said Cubbage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"" "a spokesman of the University and Somerville College stated in an email statement that" "" "we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urges the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate it strengthen themselves," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip who said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that they were both them and Warren in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for re-implementation of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything has been announced, everything is being implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria listed on the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly funded doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no state programmes, and we will not give anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">"" "" "" "Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission." ""</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian point of sale rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">No one has to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the WADA by the conduct of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">The answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low compliance results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of annoyances in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Converscent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Converscent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As GLINT, Converscent companies can send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline where employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Converscent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that handles its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Converscent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company Converscent deploys, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - are identified and addressed quicker.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employee Engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty washing going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Converscent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors supporting both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Converscent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only possible.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Converscent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well. companies are going well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the employee commitment according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can demotify disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow, employees ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was by speed of decision making and the quality of communication capable of reorganizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company will gain new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 23 o'clock, when a lot of UCLA footballers entertain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus.</seg>

<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood has postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six seasons in West wood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to last 18 exercises during the month of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a sip hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophairic Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"" "" "" "what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2295">'a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac steering iewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb imprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s that worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time one kindled a fire on account of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were even there.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome grudge") this seems to be too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that centuries had spent in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke to landscape painters, gardening, and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "" "and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an upheaval that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be a foreigner, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell husbands solved their debt crises by marrying up rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise landins. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its use in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week as well.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The five Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government tightens the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup failed, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the pulling attempt of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, has been negotiating in Ankara this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">"" "already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as a" "" "gift of God" "", "as he gave him the opportunity to" "" "completely clean" "" "the armed forces." ""</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the paper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncombatants in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">"" "in the general staff, there are concerns about an increasing" "" "Islamization" "" "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the ban on the ban on female soldiers, wrote the paper." ""</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large reinforcein of the army and the security forces continues.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past few months, the future of the platform shuttle has been contested over the past few months - now it is expected to go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, the marten track on which the tourist train is going to be built is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the platform shuttle in the long term, construction work on the route will begin in this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this especially for tourism," declared Minister of Transport, Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of the repair of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country is over 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railways as operators are already agreed on the technical details.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just when you thought it might not be even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are reached by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot accordingly to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that a Stepford woman would look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality," enthuses True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - last but not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities that accrue to rape if one goes a step on Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, quiet one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do men then have no Roxxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain tentatively at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is seeping through the zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots show up in a time where the rights of women are threatened world-wide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most striking aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the open eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing indicating independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the dump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small formats.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice in the United States about how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relative.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all going to strain ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of bumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship which they had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and platformer, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens of one day will no longer be repelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as a notion of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump in fact one as very mild crimes occur.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the climatising music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city won't do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Topics Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go to it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologising, while I was tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of reapers, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Because of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to the first death of the dead.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecution Authority has said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal may be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that so far no application will fulfil the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the earliest possible date.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In such a way, in compliance with the regular notice of notice, there is still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as a lower civil servant for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not be able to fill it out any more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>

<seg id="2559">He is a builder, "at the end, everything goes over my table."</seg>

<seg id="2583">While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food cannot penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are evened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium leads too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice carries a certain bacterium in its entrails.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and a diet tolerant to tryptophan promote a tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was kept separate, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial properties of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria found themselves on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed towards the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. Cruteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>

<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the State of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On April 4, we received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 euro came from the country, the rest from the community.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Program" "" "Social City" "", "where the restructuring would then be carried out." ""</seg>

<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The restructuring area would eventually be set as a byword.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The eligibility period for the funding has been running since January 1, 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey would only be carried out once, in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the statute decision should take place as soon as possible, so that the renovation can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Afterwards, Pietzschmann explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations.</seg>

<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion." ""</seg>

<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take shelter from Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he analyses the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report presented by Mr. Ulrich Weber from the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen) were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of overprint, 67 domed cats.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially when emotionality is concerned, the punishment for the students could be even more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to many other defendants, many victims invariably appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories linked to him in numerous cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of Violence Exercise at Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a cathedral spatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or co-existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to accuse him, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatz gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all those surveyed as - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">This is how the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, presents an excellent testimony, described him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always moved from grapes to children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority acquires about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to breach of rage.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just squat with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also gave ear-cowries and moved too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his retaliation, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time, the 1960s and the 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the expropriation of violence in the pre-school, these are dregs of dredging.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more familiar with its fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still zealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report about misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some involvement or co-existence in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: definitely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault contends to have entrusted itself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," said an affected deputy for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims of shame remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even commit themselves to parents and siblings, it would certainly not be a conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cats and cats rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student phrased it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insight and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it is absurd to assume that it is just ridiculous to assume that... Bubes have opened up more or more clearly or more clearly or rather than against their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed during the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, so Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-existence.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Likewise, he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot was read about" "" "forcible excesses" "" "among the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of being" "" "looked at" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this again is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There it is neatly separated: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the domed cats, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral manager of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and maligned, and suffered from them, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatz college.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "" "preschool" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatz gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims invariably rated the overall humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories link with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">That is, at most, the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for his predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently set his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the pre-school the punishment will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the risk of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when audit penalties were long forbidden in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they were in a legal grey zone, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the victims might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit has actually been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "pitfalls of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating past moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was scorched in the pre-school against adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am happy that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus slaying ear-arrows and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When corporal punishment was forbidden, he strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger described in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test punishment also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, as the domed cats only played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I was by no means saying that he was carrying a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and sweets on its own, the unruly boys are no big singers and they stand before each success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faith and warm-hearted man, from which one can not imagine that he could only do a fly a little.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former domed cats today, 23 years after his emination, visit him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domed cats are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person to whom they still look up today and whom they almost revere.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clearly: all that is accused of are education methods which were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that was just published relieves him.</seg>
