28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a of San Francisco , divided into San Francisco &apos;s medical department .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a stated that Frank lived first in Host@@ els but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to connect his family with his family was to always cook something for us to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a .
he never wanted to take part in any sort of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the current .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the Add @-@ on of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the Hollywood star has made clear in an interview now un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am always put into drawers or glued on from outside labels , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ ff to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of television with broken de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger ob@@ tains the Sport Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues looked for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 year old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their fes@@ tivity , they hun@@ ted home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at that pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he let himself lead with his family via the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports @-@ aid handed over the man from An@@ hausen within a small gala the Golden Sport pyramid .
there are no awards for the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the Sport pyrami@@ de is long .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the promot@@ er Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the pioneer al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the lava price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are uncertain in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate his death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely drive back regulations and he is strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has opportunities to offer dis@@ advant@@ aged and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes would be increased for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are saying almost elo@@ qu@@ ently .
the democratic applicant is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty @-@ wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be party internal discussions at Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , it wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , with its investment program , Clinton wants to explicitly strengthen and demand renewable energy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will generate the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the Tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign the agreement .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
they are supposed to be paid even better , says Bill Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics consider him that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , at least demanding from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fle@@ dged wife has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house is a refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are chickens .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has long been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten to suffer torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are other reasons for the escape in women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who think that as soon as they arrive in Germany are mistaken , says B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps are often considered mi@@ tig@@ ated and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , she estimates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t have to help themselves , they need more accommodation for them only , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of responsibility , some answer with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escap@@ ing women are not housed separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are stor@@ eys or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy , or will men and women stay together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that exists on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there has been around us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
assistants Stri@@ ke : demands for new work combat measures
assistant doctors have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new combat actions in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called on its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaig@@ ning measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have failed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance specialists and medical students voted for the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems that led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC executive board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour campaig@@ ning activities commen@@ cing at the beginning of September .
the differences led to the fact that resident doctors stri@@ ked six times this year , the first general out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be narrow@@ ed and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report every five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was rage .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of falling back on Russia .
the offen@@ ding was even greater , because it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the government @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations of senior officials were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce stand are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month on a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ hr@@ sti described it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is mad at the West , as it looks at its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge on the s@@ nail speed of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and l@@ essen the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for having demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep fear of regime changes .
the summit in this g@@ lit@@ tering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me once described by an analy@@ st : two countries that are cast out of the West and feel ill treated and are now allied .
nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they did not even grasp the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to under@@ line it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hostili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State are talking at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand can only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
since then , the Bank dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national trademarks .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange listing are switched to Nat@@ West .
the trademark Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private client business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now I say that we do not pursue any global objectives , but local targets .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own congreg@@ ations and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer carry on its six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bench for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these trademarks again , so I think the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he made a milestone on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori perc@@ ei@@ ves the che@@ er when he fet@@ ches victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career star@@ ches
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey to Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma has been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago with Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6.000 benefits if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had trouble at the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his skep@@ tics and return to his punishment .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions until his age at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten .
Russian Putin firing Sergei Ivan@@ ov Chief of Staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin conveniently dismissed Sergei Ivan@@ ov Chief of Staff .
for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test of trust by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the site of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as Head of State regarding draft law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin informed the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended it as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that right now .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - stum@@ bled upon great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to trust bur@@ den@@ some posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of office , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producer
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his resignation in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son comes out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son , in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff requested help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals that were sp@@ illed out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : crossing the bridge with Fi@@ fe
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pipe section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic scale on this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and bridge deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ proof high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weights about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances that the team worked on were tiny - on each side they only amounted to a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angel@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat running around and turned the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &apos;s rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left the boat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast @-@ rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor had an emergency stop , but the boat was released from the person who was navig@@ ating the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man gra@@ bs his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic wrong@@ do@@ er cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ rator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old created his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig sometime ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : in the future , investors should be taken much more strongly into the duty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable homes over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; Living &quot; concept for the next council session .
but quar@@ rel is inevitable .
first and foremost , the question is : who is supposed to build cheap apartments ?
a regulation lacks up to now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , we have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can also arise in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing construction programme that will cost millions and will still have to be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants even har@@ sh@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , as viol@@ a , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the experts .
but the program is not yet full : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of more about 1,@@ 300 affordable homes to be subsi@@ dis@@ ed over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning politi@@ cian Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of returning apartments back to the price relationship .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the western city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments can be picked up there in the price @-@ binding for affordable apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased , one gets away from the goal of what is called &quot; mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president , Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although this has focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside for playing , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been depl@@ eted by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more user than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ em@@ on who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found they can be &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the ma@@ dness and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tra@@ cked 35@@ ,000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people , which exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they enjoy .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
as always there are stor@@ my per@@ ks , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have been able to track our activity earlier , they have no reason to do sport as it does .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world , helping many people to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on all line .
and now finally Olympics Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast clin@@ ched the competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five , team @-@ amer@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American Sim@@ one Bil@@ o tur@@ nt on the balance beam during the solo multi@@ campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who gains a title of competition and altogether the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the past three years , 15 world championships , including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue on her said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi@@ ethnic campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the gradu@@ ation ceremony of the retired man co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted on never having planned the future during their long way to the top , this is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - including her typical tum@@ bling pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no competition for competition , a series of victories that will last as long as she wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was easily led by two turns , the picture clou@@ ded .
Swedish jo@@ ists and floor thorns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - was l@@ ur@@ king .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain called &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans had a lead .
after her ground exercise she cast kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds of the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ous shooting in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of mass mur@@ der@@ ers , while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fires eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y case , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting lead investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic dwell@@ ings within four months and two others were wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball @-@ fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the very few of his people Ed@@ mund has a micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband , Vincent , has been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can help with a help .
Ed@@ mund could not sit or craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language called Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring it a sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented several notes on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a large number of causes : genetic like in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected all Saturday over with more ra@@ inf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ ins , the National Weather Service reported .
Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards , Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana , announced that state officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain in this area .
a flood warning system was deployed on Friday in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama while still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the A@@ mite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann states that both rivers can flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that an up@@ stream directed flood in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger as these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still attached people out of the flood water in the A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had any disabilities and he was the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they had been accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer appeared near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ra@@ inf@@ all had been completely su@@ c@@ tioned since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa &apos;s Par@@ ish and L@@ ining in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS affiliate reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa submitted 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were both flooded .
the Head of the Community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond there were emergency shel@@ ters to house the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed because of the floo@@ ding water and sand bags were provided for residents to take part , hoping to hold water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday , but no reports were reported on Friday .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police reports that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared with the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also shot were three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , shot on , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating if there could be one of the injured men of the offen@@ ders .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which have been traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ shad@@ owed the scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were seals .
thus there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; reports police man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di from the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by an ag@@ ger on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present at the Women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Katho@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ n@@ ellers was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport , but gymnas@@ tics in the whole country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ders in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts primarily in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents , who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are located in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to be inspired by countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to make a more affordable and accessible gymnas@@ tics training .
I founded my foundation for 20 years .
during my events we have offered free and affordable r@@ ents in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for being motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their journey , to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors would like to organize further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors who voted in favour of a vote refused .
in July , Hun@@ t plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the staff and patients .
the first resident doctors are supposed to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the care for normal watch times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee for Regi@@ ons , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance specialists will still have serious concerns on the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and will admini@@ ster it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
the BM@@ A &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes through discussions caused the government to participate and sometimes silence on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was due to a promise by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t for the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance specialists have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in granting coverage to physicians on the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed Treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistance specialists to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour competition measures achieve nothing of the little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last two months we talked to the co @-@ committee of the resident doctors and responded positively to the concerns about gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional time , training k@@ sts , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were concerned with respect to the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year , and a quarter of them suffer a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form t@@ opp@@ ings .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , established by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Engineering Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture lets bri@@ gh@@ ten electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report due to corruption
a culture of political rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today revealed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les gra@@ c@@ efully acc@@ uses police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse due to &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption @-@ king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut @-@ off tapes outside of bal@@ lot cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should have a badge to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name merely his name and address .
the report proposes to put un@@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but also serves to protect the municipal government from wider corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ and@@ als in eastern London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man was said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation in which a person as someone else chooses .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of let@@ tering - with the older members of the Muslim community putting pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding le@@ aps to prove identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence has been placed that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on political activists to edit letters of letters to stop &quot; elec@@ tive harv@@ ests . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the election list being used for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications on an automatic letter of letters .
ban for political activists to complete complete mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes of post@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of the law facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation pursuant to the 1983 repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees generally prevail that elec@@ tors go to the bal@@ lot alone .
Sir Eric notices the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty for a number of reasons - in line with the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the town halls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election registration departments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgement in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heritage as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy for Kate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have passed this week on the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ ose of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only athlete to have gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ oni@@ ques that have more than a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides Kate doubles partner on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any simil@@ arity except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ dy told Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford , British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should go through as a doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African flo@@ ater Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user considers that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are nearly identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer died &quot; like a low &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style squ@@ ad@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been picked up in the team of comment@@ ators on board to give more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could be heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
too excited , going down like a low , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ ine twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as the final 4 x 200 free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard , in which many people were talking
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # is disgu@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming performance was broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we &apos;re sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to B@@ emer@@ kt about Twitter
Scott Russ@@ el , a comment@@ ator , had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and ap@@ ologi@@ zed to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our crowd in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zing to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no contemp@@ t intended and I &apos;m very sorry about it . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , drew her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , was moving again and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching anyone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how hard to think that someone would take home under@@ pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of sales after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had them and pulled them out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happening on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him something safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers nearby .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or the back , this video will show you how to turn your predat@@ or around .
if you are approached from behind , then you should turn first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; move out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m arm and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with your knee in the l@@ ath and twist while the aggres@@ sor squ@@ ir@@ ks before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , put the weight on the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip , before they move backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is best to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right scra@@ pes his tongue for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and th@@ ang@@ ing lex to a serious test - by dra@@ gging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dropped out his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a fl@@ ushing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ aning every object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what to do .
but the experiment , which was filmed by the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the light .
the thought of le@@ aking up the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact , in a kitchen sink there are more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left that he le@@ aned , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ets of toilets , the task posed his immune system definitely among a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to live up to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test painting showed a lumin@@ ometric count of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet , which he refused to lick off after their L@@ umin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os senior vice president for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that &apos;s fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things that I had ordered him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social home after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing with an amount of £ 50,000 because it terror@@ ised their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were whit@@ ew@@ ashed , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for housing management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive shou@@ ting , stri@@ fe and flight .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances , old litter was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood boards were torn
neighbours said they saw her fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing made her and her partner forci@@ bly removed from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to Hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we call the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information we have provided .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing on the floor
workers in the house management will now have to ev@@ acu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having found guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say that they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not obey house rules
Angela C@@ row of the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police reported that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing was a clear warning to the other tenants unable to abide by the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
Portugal &apos;s tourists panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet flies over the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal were experiencing the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the Air Force put an incredible storm
the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but persi@@ sted in preventing a safety risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashed across a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft was flying near the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal almost within reach .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the exhau@@ sting plants without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro arrived in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and so that it had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokesman said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the area , but the air forces insisted that security at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people died on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - strong fog and smoke , which restricted his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step to win the first title win in the new season of the football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup in front of FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ we@@ aver has to ren@@ ounce N@@ ey@@ mar in the power em@@ power@@ ing with the lower cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion , competing with Brazil the Olympic So@@ ccer Tournam@@ ent .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a bend in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique finally refra@@ ined from making a clear decision , leaving Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in the majority of the remaining applications .
before the first obligatory game of the new season , the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness level of the crew who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test match of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really really know about S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday at the Pro@@ par@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille , on the other hand , continues to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for second triumph in the Super@@ cop@@ a de España .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with 11 successes so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma Long in its own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
thus the World Ranking First Prize awarded the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ pe@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with themselves .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches to this place have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said consequ@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag were awarded .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
then he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang with a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed .
but nevertheless enough stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Miz@@ pe@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had a ri@@ pping last , was then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had , by the way , become Olympic champi@@ ons in a similarly high table tennis tournament .
Donald Tr@@ ump cleared out ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states to lose its majority .
Donald Tr@@ ump Pres@@ idential candidate now admitted weaknesses of his campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ asser@@ ting mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as much concern as correspon@@ dents reported .
after throwing 16 ri@@ vals in his own republi@@ can camp from the race , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bl@@ aming false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sni@@ pe .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will either be successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if for him at the end , for reasons of political correctness , this is okay , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to cancel funds to support his campaign , he should not be able to present any better results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , we want to strengthen the Republi@@ cans &apos; candidates for Congress more strongly than the poor .
Olympia : three @-@ day sc@@ am in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan worker informed that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ er .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the World Federation of IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case to make its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesman announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will carry out an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ uson and signed the trial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ yan &apos;s Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ er had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to have informed him about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against money payments athletes of his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya is already under special observation in the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing agreements .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken part in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches have always been raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically supp@@ ressed .
for this reason , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their speed and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that Bernstein &apos;s music really is in our blood !
in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is up @-@ to @-@ date with the &quot; West Side Story : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , back then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were at the time .

Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , reports according to reports in Syria .
the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e , said that her family had learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had for@@ s@@ aken the land @-@ torn country and returned to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London went to an airplane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ i@@ dency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked gar@@ lands approval since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect Clinton to &quot; select &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he hadn &apos;t spoken to Clinton yet if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the highest judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ can block the Gar@@ lands Nom@@ ination , be the lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants N@@ ude Calendar for &quot; Women and For Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine is working with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ eved to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks that it does the calendar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .
models can submit their images online or in person at an open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass ex@@ odus
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Domains foundation Di@@ alogue and World . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the Association , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh h@@ acking of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already over@@ hau@@ led Kur@@ ds with imp@@ unity a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were on the run .
after the s@@ worn put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chairman of the Association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
in doing so , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or driven out over the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman of the association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is held . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire marking as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alist and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near@@ Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the paper on the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks were the largest group of asylum entitled asylum seekers in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as asylum seekers have been recognised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are not those who are in danger of war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
weird Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
in 2021 , the state election will not come again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as so far it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - it bites itself .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the election fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t be allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are also practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers , hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count out voices at the end , only ti@@ res@@ ome .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania will have to leave the country over for an election campaign .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and there is also something going on : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a coalition of the SPD / CD@@ U , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how much newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ases a little with the people , just as his legendary , elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , Se@@ ering got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the Af@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ om . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is to make election campaigns at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale surveys ; Merkel Bundestag election circle is in the northeast .
but the audience didn &apos;t agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Sax@@ onia da Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U will largely wai@@ ve the usual campaig@@ ning conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , co@@ king , plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noticed that in the country you crum@@ ble the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly exists in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert on his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is a lot of stake in the game , Sell@@ ering called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at last 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the land day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and make their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she calls the regional president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for indigenous voters among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the leading candidate , wa@@ v@@ eth straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise .
&quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October , everything should be ready .
the opposite of those responsible for the construction works will also be praised , for instance when it comes to setting up residence entran@@ ces .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was cancelled , and so that the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the village relaxed .
the citizens can now drive on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been some significant problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many roads were looking for and more familiar with their navigation device than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fra@@ ying in residential areas .
since the speed limits were also not observed , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exceed@@ ances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been bom@@ bed .
the fastest was at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales break@@ through@@ s leaves everyone who asks them to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mile@@ age is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals are the most exploited along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , propriet@@ or of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cited the sales losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dropped back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted otherwise .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it points to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now looking less frequently because of the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t get there , it &apos;s also nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his family @-@ kli@@ fts come back after the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis , which his host has experienced in her long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the time , laws have been scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now propos@@ ing a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was at results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has let a little time pass before he presents his conclusions about security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security authority to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is launching a second start for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to impose sympathy for terror groups and kno@@ cks jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conce@@ des the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything , which in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner has no chances at any given time .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a few new ideas as well .
some of them have in themselves : he is planning rapid de@@ port@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Dul@@ ce for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of it is political and legal .
some also have an unpleasant effect and leave questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it can &apos;t be said that the Ans@@ bach and Würzburg assass@@ inations were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that people deeply engaged were not clas@@ hing even in election times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on inner security .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
in the last days there was a high tide between the two parties .
it is only a gar@@ ris@@ ome dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , where the resort &apos;s chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he keeps nothing from a return from the double @-@ pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it , do not make sense .
and in case of a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package at all corners is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be seen .
there is a lot in it , which might cause controversy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is currently attempting to distinguish itself on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further improving security . &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
despite diesel prices , shipment volumes are increasing worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term in the recall campaign .
Volkswagen starts with deliveries more restra@@ ined in the second half of the year .
despite the many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer continues to offer a plus in the course of the year .
but in July VW &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as the company listed in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second @-@ largest market alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market Germany the deliveries dropped by almost a sixth .
head of the market , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , reduced the weaker figures from July above all to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU has also bur@@ dened a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated , there is also a decline in a minus .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , Lower Saxony &apos;s mainly affected household brand got off lightly anyway : after the first seven months , only an output minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles can be found .
group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating exhaust gas testing software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the automobile manufacturer guarantees a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate to the customer after retro@@ fitting , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called in company circles on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a warranty for re@@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the warranty that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting , there are no deterior@@ ations and all typical vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid that in the event of any other damage that has nothing to do with the gas scandal , there is uncertainty about possible warranty claims as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for rich savings in future punishment - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
as of September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund reserves this charge from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposits or day @-@ to @-@ day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been holding 40 million euros for quite some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now continues the cost according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle .
to leave the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ins , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank manager .
most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not economically feasible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 made head@@ lines with penalty chu@@ cks for deposits tot@@ alling € 3 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay large deposits for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is a bit more luxuri@@ ant by the fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no further banks are currently known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ PR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to the negative to private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please that in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men of middle aged love plates .
prior to commenting on the comment section , under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Al@@ le@@ Ein@@ hei@@ men &apos;s middle @-@ aged men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the above @-@ mentioned resurrection of records is not based on a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffy before I stop , hold my hands and say something special like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I run from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already value , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 working with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers he meets on You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the media player , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually dischar@@ ged themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to supporters of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a store like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans of the record feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl sleeves , from objects that watch joyful singing memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what I am a collector , and I think it is so with a lot of people .
it is a simple way of working spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while browsing through a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone just recently got in here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP to put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ like , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who are coming in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the record almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ ans out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks odd , but na@@ iling psychological trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates sold for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping as a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the ticket to my pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group together for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of boards from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are dis@@ regarded , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard in school or in offices .
they certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bees through panels of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets , while they avoid the star@@ tling look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary establishments , in which persons within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to final drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes were paid and which would pose a fire and safety risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants often would provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely track@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just nour@@ ishing people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp which is operated non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it meant that closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of the living in the jungle has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
in spite of his disap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic sailing season , Rad@@ immer@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get it down .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he doesn &apos;t have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse calm@@ ly what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time ahr World Championship in Qatar in Qatar , Martin really wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time touring world champion , who on Wednesday lost 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ omes will be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident points , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or bridges with temporary speed control , there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measurement mode , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as transit prohi@@ bitions to time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer , according to the manufacturer , can be moved in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ apped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sweat @-@ proof outer cover van@@ ish .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the flash from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also being used .
even foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ s ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class picks gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ Series ru@@ g@@ by ended on Thursday evening at an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on it in the final .
but regardless of that Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ ji &apos;s head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss of Wim@@ ble@@ don England .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they only lost one .
this stage will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonder@@ full and let the attacks boun@@ ce off from fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved around in the corner .
with another four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a ra@@ ging t@@ ack of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua came to a show@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new feature since the restart and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while still learning the UK .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ an , whose fans sang , sw@@ elled flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged themselves and GB did not cr@@ ush into the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the first half forward , but Dan Nor@@ ton went through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the trainer &apos;s Cancer to win a row victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than in these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard k@@ ieve who go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present when they row@@ ed for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9th un@@ fired use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant women who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in the herd , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the trainer who didn &apos;t know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer who was oper@@ able and they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky enough to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , off the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if it was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be sufficient .
that &apos;s how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning with something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en , and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency deployment on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there have always been new additions because water is living and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Go@@ l &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he actually lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the recipe for success of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate cut in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken Water Forum .
he received a lot of praise and praise for that .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
he described the well construction and re@@ structure of the association as high points from his point of view .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the rup@@ ture of the pipe at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because one filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed she must die .
but the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago seemed to be well ahead and now I &apos;m studying in private in New York , where the best therapists are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that is two years behind when I sang at La Scala , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting for life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10 : 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after he is publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still have the weapon in his hand , so the police .
the one who sees Sven S. is to call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no information about the operation or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ laden and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Survey at the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG lev@@ y is reduced by 20 percent .
but this , too , will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
this means that the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy , when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China cast a massive steel on the world market in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed .
on the one hand , imported import duties have an effect on import steel , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how long @-@ lasting the price over@@ haul is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp meant not to exclude the closing of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced now went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : she was a young girl in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt School she finished music and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels refresh@@ ed , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German sen@@ iors division .
most sen@@ iors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve at age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly calls his lungs does not get out of the pu@@ dding too fast even in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older people often have a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations , singing together had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people who have fallen ill will remember long @-@ lying events .
when singing , a special achievement is demanded , explained L@@ enz .
concentrating on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone exercise so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing are enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz reveals .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes next to it ?
in search of suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings out of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbors can ask for help on the Internet research .
anyone wanting to sing should join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on kit@@ tens scre@@ ams
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the rep@@ lication of kit@@ tens has on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ dge didn &apos;t let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to ly@@ te of kit@@ tens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of kit@@ tens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited squ@@ abs for the males are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology .
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ tens shou@@ ting differ with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of little ones , which were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited kit@@ tens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have not had their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited kit@@ tens played off .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , no matter whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala . &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the Erz@@ riv@@ ets between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the arrest of the state of emergency in July , the government was already bet@@ ting on normal citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , responsible for the coup attempt .
football doesn &apos;t stop there , too .
the Prosecutor &apos;s Office issued an arrest warrant against former St@@ our@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ dau@@ r .
according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kt@@ r is to be the supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , this really has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan declared for an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and enemies of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks united in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will come especially back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved his athle@@ tic value : with 17 gates and nine models in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the Final Game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered on him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion had a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leave early in the Europa League too early . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g there was only third place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez who , with 26 rounds of the season as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig , laid the foundation for the 14th Tit@@ le .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue hoping for the return of the 31 year old .
on the occasion of the coup attempt at AC Florence , the om@@ ez borrow@@ ed from Bes@@ ik@@ tas had announced , after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to do so , the Stür@@ mer would have to be prepared to ren@@ ounce on around a third of his annual sal@@ aries estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man realized : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at this - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the subject of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines in the Rio Olympics .
Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing block compla@@ ined their initial law shortly before the games , was pi@@ tied and rested on their start ( 100 metres of breast ) .
it offered a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : she was still in the hall with a smile and had prov@@ oked her performance .
when it was determined that she would not get gold , the audience burst into a che@@ er tower .
but there are many other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the Rio Olympics in the Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been even faster than ever before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to lock a six @-@ month lock after her taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , world champion of 2013 and European championships , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic testi@@ fied for the sent@@ encing and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , eu@@ ph@@ ered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athlete was recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after testosterone dop@@ ing was found in him .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European Championships 2006 for testosterone ab@@ norm@@ alities .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also recognized as a result of a judgment of the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence for taking a banned supplement was found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and expi@@ red on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the Foreign Ministry spokesman , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ell , Friday morning .
she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I had already left it .
her journey home I planned for the beginning of September .
it is unclear whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens .
in this regard , the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as necessary .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life quarter .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two war@@ heads again went up , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in det@@ on@@ ation close to the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media , too , wanted to recognize a pattern which is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist revolt or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs have been placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have been receiving secret information about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - although they have not been informed of the exact date and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police deployed their officials throughout the country to provide security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace , which was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to comply with the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
higher security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution which was dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody civil un@@ rest , has helped itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not manage to get a grip on the rebel uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok on an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the constitutional obj@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ison of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being ign@@ ited in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is directed against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Compla@@ ins in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ison said his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ it@@ ous advertising for your own business .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were given to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase of rights @-@ motivated off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ison said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have established that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee disasters or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a German@@ - wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many people went to the account of people who hadn &apos;t appeared in the right scene before .
this is the cause of concern .
many of the suspect &apos;s attacks on asylum @-@ lod@@ gings were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who have then ra@@ dic@@ alized by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always are the Olympics or World Records the head@@ lines in the Olympics .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros &apos;s Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia came so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race of 48 seconds and finished in 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special status law from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries better known .
as most sports@@ men run in a@@ edi@@ c@@ ia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he hit the 100 m Fre@@ estyle only with a minute and almost five seconds , playing no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea flo@@ ater , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Frei@@ stil .
at that time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired on f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learnt to swim in front of the Olympics for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the lo@@ oming electoral defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking on an election campaign in Florida .
if there &apos;s nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump is already an alternative video .
he then drive on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , he wouldn &apos;t care : &quot; ultimately it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can Candi@@ date in a telephone interview with the US TV broad@@ caster CN@@ BC .
if for him at the end , for reasons of political correctness , this is okay , he said , Tr@@ ump said .
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle obviously is great .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
shortly , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric v@@ ans from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ Board Jürgen Ger@@ der said that there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely inquiries , for example from craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner company plans to enter mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will complete the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
fi@@ bre@@ glass leadership emerging after disap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its chief Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uncertain as to the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again disap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new start .
the GF@@ RP Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the G@@ RP Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ers , is already leaving the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
the management board of the Executive Board , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , member of the Executive Board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , took over the company as early as 1 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokesman did not want to mention details on Friday .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in investor circles it was on Friday that the shareholders had recently been a big disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring carried out years ago .
Hart@@ mann has been working on the Gf@@ K leadership since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shareholders will eventually become dis@@ quiet at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case at BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company could not stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in terms of the first half of the year , revenue shr@@ ank by 3.@@ 4 percent to EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter has mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s sun@@ k value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the group posted a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million in the Consumer Experience business unit , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , amoun@@ ting to EUR 139 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into crow@@ s in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ interro@@ n : eight injured
in the event of an accident involving a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ interro@@ n ( District Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , announced the police .
according to her data , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her data to an out@@ going vice , which was partly on the back road .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ gade was liberated by the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured trav@@ eller was brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ aph@@ ne district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of waste water will amount to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl on October 1 , 2016 and 3.@@ 36 euros for the supply of the sewage plant / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ rate calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach it was established that under@@ cover works for these sewage systems .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Hen@@ der@@ tenberg have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period .
Schmidt explained the serious charges raised by the fact that all three sewage plants handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , lying between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs could have a serious impact on several thousand euros .
in addition , the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
in the rec@@ umbent calculation period , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses were incurred in all three plants in a considerable amount not least due to the age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as appro@@ vals , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage in the sewage plant of Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and at the water treatment plant in Lop@@ p , the first sewage plant had to be excav@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to meet the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , continued assistance and maintenance costs were incurred , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , Schmidt continued to spare the market community of major entertainment costs for sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years .
according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious , particularly since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al sewage treatment association cannot be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit institution .
Bulgaria marks inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.8 % ) ; transportation ( 1,8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
the prices fell on clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can transform into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ am@@ eless , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies a day .
all mis@@ steps arrive to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critical in the past in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face fo@@ e or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and star@@ ved che@@ eks , some revi@@ e@@ wers called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversy had pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was meant as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter rec@@ alled vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and the least said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yel@@ lowing face has been dra@@ gged into the ab@@ ov@@ elling extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration warfare , from conference rooms to Hollywood and appliances that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people , who are more different than their older counter@@ parts in terms of race , could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was in the past , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu , for the great part , critici@@ zed white male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ am Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Sn@@ ap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on hetero@@ geneous population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on the other hand , said that she closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence service information , re@@ jects Congress Committee
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information in order to draw a more optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual conditions on site , an inquiry committee of the Congress filed a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Conf@@ lic@@ ts , Intelligence Commit@@ tees and Ar@@ med Bud@@ get@@ ary , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically spur@@ red by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly reported a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leading errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , statements and statements prior to Congress were significantly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mozambique could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ year 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans launched Task Force after they were admitted that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while continuing the investigation .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ com reports is underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for creating intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; stated the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaging mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were taken up by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesman , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the In@@ spec@@ tor &apos;s investigations were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism with regard to the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes between more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush presented only a small occupying force in Iraq and refra@@ ined from making thoughts about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker noted that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Colonel , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after having fired three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two matches should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of those who keep their gates in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she knows this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are on the first place in their group with the Brit@@ on who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place respectively .
the first placed will leave the strong Dutch somewhat longer from the path that the other group will lead .
whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey mal@@ let in hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the ca@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , where everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we have now .
we have the helm all around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a hand@@ shake from the local area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the tra@@ mp &apos;s Zen
wherever you are , as late as it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning bar , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to a swi@@ mmer to a gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples , would certainly have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline tournament .
the Olympic flame is not the same for every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign long .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived so spar@@ sely the last 16 years that many of them , I had sur@@ vey@@ ed , did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete up to 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London .
the jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it is more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a dev@@ out enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and scuba diving , the two sports that are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and have to move a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are assessed according to the official course of the Olympic program , according to version , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight forward .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go on in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall , but also another high end in television transmission : the world &apos;s or the Olympic med@@ ley .
the goal oriented aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the re@@ bo@@ under of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces down , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant ann@@ ul@@ ment of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen like the competition at the Olympics only can be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympic Man@@ ia , they promise a calm , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the objective of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently proposed - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ shots .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a sound ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was mer@@ cil@@ ess .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen fired and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
the circul@@ ating videos about the protests , presumably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader for the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , although dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said See@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ sigh@@ ted election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions are rising along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this fragile , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can use the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess are now explo@@ ding after years of bending down under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians believed that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was prime minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say that he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ Maritime Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al was 2005 after thousands of prot@@ esters prot@@ ested , which , according to data from analysts , were apparently fu@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest went over relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty eradic@@ ation .
but obviously this did not prevent the internal mis@@ understanding of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month Prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , businesses run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a strange position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed its base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama has been founded in IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton had not been seriously meant to be the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who try to protect him during an event@@ ful period of protection , into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant .
after making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ru@@ de back in reference to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism jumps down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling survey results on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s email , but later on , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction occurs . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted a more corro@@ sive tone , as its results have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour .
but while focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze brought his loyal comrades into the in@@ convenient situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , had great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani thus said he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements if Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that , before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ches , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans attempt to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread in aggres@@ sively taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology rather than evidence that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed over the price off the market , Cafe in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fake cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were sup@@ planted .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals tou@@ red it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ mp wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and club is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also new finding .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nish@@ es such as cap@@ ers and aci@@ di@@ fied onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s prizes , &quot; he said .
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after closing the verb , she stopped the coffee for a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went to work there and inevitably posed the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still ordering his usual ordering , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment whatsoever that the soap business took the old business space .
indeed , the owners of the soap cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll enter her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he planned to issue her soon so that his new neighbors could feel welcome .
the location has other advantages as well .
a local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet chef , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land tor@@ to@@ ise soup .
his menu on that day was slightly more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ da &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; she told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
her latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per publishing house , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ak@@ y snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter asked hack@@ ers , this found the couple matching for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces the ways in which the country avoided being the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food , such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es , became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; the bri@@ ck@@ man noticed , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients in a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
unique mix@@ tures were tried as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish of this time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home economics recipes .
like never before or ever , budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - committed the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and challenge the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic delicacies .
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ fold man of the world he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt could have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt meant that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting preparations . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country returned to its legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
after the plate was cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , she and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt did eat at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only prun@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed a little bit reluct@@ antly to catch a spoon into the t@@ amed brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E took a three @-@ fold supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in the Assad regime &apos;s barrel bomb attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers set up their own lives to move people out of bom@@ bed homes and provide first aid in the area of war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Defence , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees in me a marty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels of barrels over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chl@@ oric gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest typ@@ ho@@ on is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ red usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ k only get offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches just 1.@@ 220 meters in average .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6m / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long assumed that Greenland ha@@ i@@ h will be stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland shar@@ k .
her slow @-@ motion was to say that she had six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , prey make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland ha@@ i@@ dens , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest was 50@@ 2 cm .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins they contain will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search resulted in greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ l , on the other hand , contained a small amount of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ dens had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in its l@@ enti@@ cular @-@ nucle@@ us , that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re @-@ long shar@@ k @-@ shar@@ k , while the record @-@ shar@@ k should be even 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to attribute the length to an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ h with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such Meth@@ us@@ el@@ ites live in icy waters , especially in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
they mature then later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources rather in a long life .
building site in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with topics around construction , the council has focused on the most recent meeting in the recent meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board announced the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of recently designated residential areas can start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the development , par@@ cel@@ li@@ zation and development issues could be clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons to be sur@@ vey@@ ed , there is nothing in the way for the sale of the land in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ tension section 1 ) .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ ily will be able to report in the town hall right away , and the council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to meet even requests to settle further industrial enterprises , linked to job creation , the council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year .
thus , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
therefore , the city of the Main has the best chance of attracting new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will be allowed to run further from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK is sufficient .
that is explo@@ iting major US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counts with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a big fund industry , but does not cut down as well as Dublin in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city is equipped with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main River .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company advisory Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked seventh , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin to No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the business researchers .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was freed from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ van@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the law@@ suit was collected on Thursday , US president Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the decree of the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck inter@@ sec@@ ted each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that clo@@ cked sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops supported by the US have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokesman for the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ing after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians being held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton earned USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publishing house for her book about her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine of Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax returns of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and re@@ porters referring to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter in reference to the publication of the Democrats &apos; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ vis@@ ors , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax inspections are not completed .
the critics , among others the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations to charity organisations , his business conduct and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting senior Republi@@ cans Tr@@ ump to release his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , which stated that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton endor@@ ses a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that people with more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha last week , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clinton Conference showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their principal financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from entering inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ powder .
the method has proven effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has intensified its support along with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit we were able to observe a change in attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bli@@ ster in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom fits with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust of ch@@ ili@@ powder into the air .
a breath is usually sufficient to chase the elephant .
one last possibility is a ver@@ tex that shoots a fire@@ work fire@@ work into the air , causing a noisy , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ people , but at this location in the exposed location on the bank of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk is not suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ sec@@ ts Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election since it had claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ oked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have asked that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lanz@@ mann employee was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ blatt called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response from the Internet where people called it a scandal .
some were subordin@@ ating to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; given up the supposed promp@@ tings of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct directive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to put Israel into the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police op@@ poses Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ eus to prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police in Sao Paulo , Brazil on Thursday , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reform for the public education system .
the police launched tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants looked at Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ to @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest shown on the part of Russian companies in the country has increased strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies have established connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 was 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan represents a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation issued around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , first and foremost travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
looked for : beverage market inf@@ ested in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y case was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a gun , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the beverage brand , and subsequently fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money has been captured .
the perpetrators were said to have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres tall , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the offen@@ ders have to be banned in the direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and can be fled with the silver @-@ colored car opposite the car park entrance , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun at summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
during the first school holiday week , the fun @-@ loving group was lod@@ ged in a quiet leisure time in Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ loo@@ ster with the visit of the match @-@ z@@ oos .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group met at the Deep Sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
children and car@@ ers were treated to culinary delicacies , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ c , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s Gate to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the min@@ ts from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ esh@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were tac@@ kled together .
in order to bridge the period up to the next pilgrimage tour of all the min@@ ts in the course of two years , the St. Anna District Council decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided in favour of the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the open gate of Mer@@ cy on Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of Ep@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy chambers , went their way .
in the evening before Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m crosses and distributed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b , he was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Hungarian dear wife is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and in the evening .
but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made rest to sing together a song from a specially organised pilgri@@ m song booklet .
the resi@@ dences of the local par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers were available for the nights .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and for@@ ti@@ fying dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to be lowered at first about 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the lake in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg to the final stage .
the min@@ is visi@@ bly ligh@@ tened and happily met the Min@@ is in the later afternoon at Freiburg Min@@ ster and crossed the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is , who arrived at the pilgrimage , were greeted by the Min@@ is by co@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims visited the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold won gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made . the J@@ umping and the legend hau@@ gh@@ ted the legend when he stor@@ med home to get a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y claimed the fifth of the six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after finishing in March at the London Rail World Championships in London , despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des appeared .
Ho@@ ys retirement has created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that is now un@@ folding .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner set up an olymp@@ ic record in the qualification laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der lay almost behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , when Hin@@ des went into a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC experts and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round , we set up an olymp@@ ic record and beat the world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 Triumph at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ derer admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no obj@@ ections to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ derer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in velo@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ dick , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same as that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y comes next in the spr@@ int that will start today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ derer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Robert dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
yesterday he had cont@@ ested with representatives before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong train bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background in the background , so the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton technical director in April in the midst of sex and bul@@ lying proposals as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land as a result of the abolition of the energy demand
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thereby aboli@@ shes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to run the plant .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old subsi@@ dy exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect , as the sm@@ el@@ ting mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of total electricity generation Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the fishing industry last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulations concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , most recently , due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ts with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the earnings of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been depreci@@ ated in its annual subscription of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; waiting for a termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to negotiate the contracts is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that 2010 concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force in November this year , even if there is yet another explanation as to why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and a total of 900 MW of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
revealing the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , a cri@@ p@@ pled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular show bi@@ z on@@ c@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this is the c@@ lich@@ y story of almost every birthday sep@@ tum of a child &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris did not have to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim loves her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were advertising of the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome ( 6@@ 15 pages adverti@@ s@@ ment ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success for everyone .
with her reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the mis@@ understanding , it seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of them on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational Centr@@ es annually assign 16@@ 0.000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary needs are rejected by the congreg@@ ational centres each year , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further aver@@ aging on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ u@@ sions and similar policies - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ booked , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell &apos;s congreg@@ ational centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es found that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only exac@@ erb@@ ate the situation without lifting the resolution of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dis@@ cour@@ aged - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the federal government will cut its resources by 30 per cent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these mi@@ dd@@ le@@ ties so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the congreg@@ ational centres and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly drew arms
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after announ@@ cing that their campaign leader for North Carolina put a gun on an employee in February while they were on a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr B@@ ordin@@ i gave up for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the course of Vincent &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having appe@@ aled to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other persons had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dissolved an u@@ pro@@ ar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge ap@@ point a judge .
Tr@@ ump campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not be able to inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint claims damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and of Philip due to injury to the body and permanent psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to contact Philip as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of the SPD and CD@@ U elections
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could not go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible according to the survey data in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to position the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party only narrow@@ ed narrow@@ ly before the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 per cent again .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
despite slight losses , the Green Party returned to the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
the N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent each .
according to the survey , the SPD in Berlin had only 23 percent of the poll@@ s ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they still lie behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its maker experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it wasn &apos;t good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they are somehow from the stone age of the internet age .
twenty years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax it was possible to reach Communic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible by HTML browser , even if tor@@ menting slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone sector experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled to Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere today is a daily routine for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smart phone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily operate everything via touch screen .
the success story of Apple began , even today , iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had the following .
they finally disappeared to fight Black@@ berry .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already introducing 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the He@@ ath@@ row extension is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be f@@ ading on the world stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
extension is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion on ho@@ wit@@ ing growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world .
they are now ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London 2012 Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass the ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
in a blog post the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of back and forth struggle between the scheduled open source community and the envel@@ opes has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display blo@@ ggers have become for the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ lip and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of fac@@ ebook advertising revenue .
the company is not targeting desktop PCs since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker shared .
advertising on Desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears worthwhile to invest in such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook denied that Ad@@ block would cause new filters to be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Facebook spokesman announced in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as ad preferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman in case of presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman was driving on a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that , at the age of 49 , a Swiss woman who was convic@@ ted of several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who invited them and every witness to the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs along the highway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent murder after having killed and killed a man lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , responding to an emergency call -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; totally exceptional and un@@ predictable situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the judge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived as inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus probably was once inhabited .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still turned on slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also prof@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day@@ time side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained Mr. G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees col@@ der than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet scientists .
although it was supposedly hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billion years .
her oceans evapor@@ ated and her water vap@@ our was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen@@ omes only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus that we know them today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as a trainer
on Thursday , Patrick Roy returned as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and introduced a too low right to co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
as an alternative president / general manager of the Color@@ ados , Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been thinking long and much about how to improve this team in the course of the summer , to give it more depth to it and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the coach &apos;s vision and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations need to be perfectly att@@ un@@ ed to that of the organization .
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these terms are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has been honoured as the best coach of the League at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed out in every of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ eed oil workers resume talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike out strike &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes with regard to the remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the con@@ ten@@ ders sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group Oil Field Service Provider were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the UN and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of disman@@ tling the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to re @-@ address the problems .
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell announced for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its Mega@@ composition with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that happened since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the P@@ lei@@ adi@@ c star cluster
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve around the star cluster to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planet creation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other Stern@@ enh@@ aufen , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood now .
they are now fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby bigger stars are slower than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; says Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; Stern@@ enh@@ aufen offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , both younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak , hang their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ads rotation rates that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball player in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional resignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12th against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star Game competitor of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mile@@ stones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not supposed to be recorded in the rest of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so succ@@ es@@ fully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have ster@@ oids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forbidden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received powerful funding for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have taken me a favour for 2014 , because I have played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days are also not silent .
while many bas@@ eball players once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a goodbye tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and re @-@ rec@@ alled the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston red so@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sang the followers at 4 : 9 defeat against Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ich@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
an educated athlete would have won almost a medal .
the first official dop@@ ing events in Rio de Janeiro have been known before the seventh day of competition .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter obstacle runners sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ap@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have had to take part in the events of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full co @-@ operation during the investigation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ap@@ owa was also le@@ aking in the night of Rio , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should deal with the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ap@@ owa was suspended preliminary , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately addressed criticism of the athlete &apos;s speech .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ich@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation of IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team up to an exemp@@ tion from systematic dop@@ ing , but Kenya &apos;s country nation produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China were also cat@@ ered for serious conflicts between the athletes .
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang hard .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ ores purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the Podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass it over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested in 2014 by the Chinese championships in a positive way to the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to shut down a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail software currently target companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialists Mal@@ v@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , in part , victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ran@@ som required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ cau@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators special@@ ise in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som can be significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ wa@@ y@@ tes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the transition to company attacks was sho@@ ck@@ ingly fast in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage comes from when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or de@@ code example files for free .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed after payments of just a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit margins in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware repair kits were created by purchasing the malware yourself , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes with an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ v@@ y@@ tes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful assass@@ ination , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ wa@@ y@@ tes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetrators could also take entirely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heating could indeed be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , but only the top of the cockpit is falling .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l for folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a seat and offer storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling .
the trunk is well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering would be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed sensor responds to traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when needed .
the full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI @-@ socket are located below the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are all right .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel starting at 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible with dangers that are typical of air transport .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general life risk , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay ?
after their journey , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel .
however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , on the second day of her Turkish holiday , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting .
she almost spent the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective treatment plant , which supposedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip had been poor - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
because no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on among themselves - is a general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must react calm@@ ly and decisi@@ vely at the same time to acts of terrorism .
sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a tran@@ sposition of the proposals until the 2017 federal election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the tru@@ ce has to be am@@ ended so am@@ ended that especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is made more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words , the last much @-@ discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is supposed to be maintained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social assistance necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed himself against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a ban on the Bur@@ ka and the abolition of double nationality before .
he considers a general prohibition of full wear under constitutional law .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d anything you reject and I lean back wearing the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or witness in court .
green Chief Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorism p@@ act and ability to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway access road
it st@@ ews itself regularly on the b@@ ypass - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is to change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ction is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams when driving across the highway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ eler road exit the right turn track by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the hammer road to the right .
the major advantage : the traffic signs up early , whereby the overall procedure is improved on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district &apos;s ple@@ a representation in Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder improves drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on the week@@ days , the return route goes up to the bridge over the Albert @-@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle @-@ pole on the B 51 shortly before the descent Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only ste@@ ered onto the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ built a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb double @-@ gauge heavy @-@ duty traffic .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the resulting work @-@ day traffic jam will last , the responsible state company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal remedy , the state company consciously chosen the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Education : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of forest school attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the NGO N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the NGO N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg of language , and the Junge Schauspiel will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background should get the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the con@@ stellation @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night on Friday a stroke by the calculation - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ ds belonging to the quick@@ est shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come out of the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips against S@@ leep Dis@@ orders
in the evening , one is lying around forever , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ up ring to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not restor@@ ative .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders occur ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter Wo@@ unded , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in and through sleep disorder .
many people feel particularly sleep@@ y when uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Association of Internal Medicine with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there may be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is especially frequent in case of depression , &quot; says Weber .
and it can be that various factors are dependent on each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can feel bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises we@@ erer .
the impair@@ ment can be quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
in order to relieve sleep problems , it is important to find out the causes .
the treatment options include , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany there is hardly any left @-@ lying dormit@@ ory , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , if you have problems with your sleep problems , you should consult your GP first .
it can be clari@@ fied with examinations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for the study in the sleep laboratory , medical professionals advise for example in snor@@ ing with respir@@ ators , in case of abnormal day@@ time fatigue , at dor@@ ms or when one does not find the cause of a breakdown incident , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make no mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after disgu@@ sting you go to bed at your normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger .
in addition , a camera at the ceiling records the sleeping .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which one can sit for a better sleep .
br@@ oth counts on : regular sleeping and up@@ setting , not too long in bed , do not sleep in bed , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself to the disap@@ pointing cut off of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us via Facebook .
in December 2014 , he had first picked up gold at the world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ compatible has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 € should nobody wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page last night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transport system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not exactly look at it or even operate it on the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , di@@ ver would have to be reported to Germany ( NA@@ DA ) nine months ahead of his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ Hamburg , who meanwhile runs an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of Car@@ rier Cu@@ bes arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 were carried out on Thursday by the civilian victims of the Düsseldorf police .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage ste@@ els as bands .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs , civilian officials at the Düsseldorf airport saw a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past anti @-@ theft off@@ ences .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences and have been working collectively , socially and especially professionally .
the Speci@@ alists of the Criminal Police Department 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves , who have been sent to Germany for the purpose of commit@@ ting criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
in the process , they had caught a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this at first glance , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when you walk the road from the east to the west , you pass play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bee store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company called Friedrichsha@@ in , will however be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the occup@@ ants have rented le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly Berlin &apos;s internal sen@@ ator Henkel has claimed repeatedly for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the premises on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , police pat@@ rolling the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked out parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers were renov@@ ating the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew under the ju@@ bil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted a majority of police protection from the left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and police between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbours make up , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working class district , which also today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainz street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under great police force in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive head@@ liners from around the world : with them residents from GDR times and former domestic occup@@ iers are now sharing their Kie@@ z .
this is also reflected in the rental rates , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : you can see them on inserted slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been ti@@ pped with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury statistics are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes make property damage , which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years besides the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architect &apos;s architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer lived consciously in the Riga street - and stayed .
this is why it was so important for her to get back her street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that the old inhabitants squee@@ ze .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are actually con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who don &apos;t feel so well are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out people who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a ta@@ vern area , can complain bad about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group for refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else interfer@@ es with .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ making wo@@ olen mil@@ ch@@ yard , which is above all a problem .
thus some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing rather than relying on the wide variety of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , just an egg @-@ like wool mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organising , working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 percent position to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ orable and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon there will be new containers in Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Office of the Land@@ rats@@ amt to the municipality and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
up to now , it does not work , but one has to rely on private dwell@@ ings , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be vali@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are soon placed in the washing street .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , are Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ ressed or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do not @-@ for @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but action does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also jump here administration and volunteers .
it is essential that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority were motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , says customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are they afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and may not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins put them in ruins completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers must look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new sto@@ ke of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics h@@ ates itself .
actually it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customers also make it clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy integrating so far into the existing people .
these are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
