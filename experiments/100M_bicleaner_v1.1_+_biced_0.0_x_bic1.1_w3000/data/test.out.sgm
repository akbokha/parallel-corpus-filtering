<seg id="1">Golfer Langer obtains the Sport Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues looked for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58 year old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "gold Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their festivity, they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at that pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself lead with his family via the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even hover for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports-aid handed over the man from Anhausen within a small gala the Golden Sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are no awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US Masterswinner was added to the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports "" "" on Saturday. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are uncertain in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "dump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively drive back regulations and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, said:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has opportunities to offer disadvantaged and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, Trump and Clinton are saying almost eloquently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical Teaparty-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party internal discussions at Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, it wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "on the other hand, with its investment program, Clinton wants to explicitly strengthen and demand renewable energy:" "" "a country will generate the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are supposed to be paid even better, says Bill Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics consider him that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, at least demanding from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are chickens.</seg>

<seg id="17">In January Condrobs worked together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>

<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps are often considered mitigated and abused in the worst case.</seg>

<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, escaping women are not housed separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are storeys or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shelters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called upon their union to approve new combat actions in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more labour campaigning measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers would have failed to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted in the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter-player in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be narrowed and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "by contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report every five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's bright, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of falling back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offending was even greater, because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the cousins will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the government-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce stand are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month on a failed coup d'état almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vehrsti described it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is mad at the West, as it looks at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued grudge on the snail speed of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and lessen the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for having demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep fear of regime changes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "Alliance of outsiders" to me once described by an analyst: two countries that are cast out of the West and feel ill treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they did not even grasp the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to underline it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing Sergei Ivanov Chief of Staff</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin conveniently dismissed Sergei Ivanov Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years, IVANOV was part of the tightest of trust by Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin, it reads that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he was later the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State regarding draft law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended it as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - stumbled upon great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to trust burdensome posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The pipe section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic scale on this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the viaduct and bridge deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure is future-proof high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weights about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny - on each side they only amounted to a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1,300 affordable homes over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "Living" concept for the next council session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who is supposed to build cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation lacks up to now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD vice-president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "if you want to build on urban areas, we have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favorable apartments can also arise in the inventory.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as Bratmann says:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harsher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as viola, there is a sharpening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet full: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of more about 1,300 affordable homes to be subsidised over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning politician Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of returning apartments back to the price relationship.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>

<seg id="27">For in the western city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments can be picked up there in the price-binding for affordable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased, one gets away from the goal of what is called "mixing."</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside for playing, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been depleted by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more user than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokemon who are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found they can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in increments that the" "" "average" "" "person restores each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracked 35,000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people, which exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "" "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are stormy perks, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they have no reason to do sport as it does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world, helping many people to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on all line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympics Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast clinched the competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five, team-ameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Simone Bilo turnt on the balance beam during the solo multicampaign of women in gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who gains a title of competition and altogether the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescue on her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multiethnic campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the graduation ceremony of the retired man co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during their long way to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - including her typical tumbling pass - is attuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside of the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym where Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no competition for competition, a series of victories that will last as long as she wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was easily led by two turns, the picture clouded.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish joists and floor thorns - in which Biles holds the world title - was lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears poured on biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal was in a tiebrake on Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain called "grandma" by the Americans had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise she cast kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds of the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present at the Women's olympionship in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Katholikin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnellers was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport, but gymnastics in the whole country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four turnerders in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents, who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are located in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to make a more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable rents in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you for being motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their journey, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Resident doctors would like to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted in favour of a vote refused.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "No Man's Land" and that any further delay would be harmful to the staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first resident doctors are supposed to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the care for normal watch times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Regions, announced last night in a message: "assistance specialists will still have serious concerns on the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and will administer it to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through discussions caused the government to participate and sometimes silence on deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the artery walls that form toppings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the floorcovering breaks apart, it can cause blood clots that clogged the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, established by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Engineering Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture lets brighten electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political rectness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as an annihilating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles gracefully accuses police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse due to "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, which is now an anti-corruption-king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut-off tapes outside of ballot cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a badge to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment a voter has to name merely his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to put unremovable ink on a person's finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this not only serves against electoral fraud, but also serves to protect the municipal government from wider corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election scandals in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "" "in a cynical way" "", "and that he would silence his critics with racial and Islamophobia accusations." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman was said to have led" "" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of imitation in which a person as someone else chooses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent letter of lettering - with the older members of the Muslim community putting pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding leaps to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it says:" "" "evidence has been placed that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there were concerns that... governmental institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to" "" "politically correct" "" "sensitivities to ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists to edit letters of letters to stop "elective harvests."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also demands tougher registration tests to prevent the election list being used for immigration and social fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications on an automatic letter of letters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban for political activists to complete complete mailings and envelopes of postings.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "the police have the authority to set up lockouts for electoral stations." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of the law facilitated an indictment for intimidation pursuant to the 1983 representation of the People Act 1983 (VolksRepresentation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training in order to ensure that the employees generally prevail that electors go to the ballot alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric notices the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal complaint was made.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," "" "he said." ""</seg>

<seg id="38">"" "Sir Eric said:" "" "the judgement in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him something safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers nearby.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn your predator around.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approached from behind, then you should turn first, so that you can see your attacker and "move out of the shot," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm arm and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with your knee in the lath and twist while the aggressor squirks before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip, before they move backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and thanging lex to a serious test - by dragging some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dropped out his train on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaning every object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed by the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to the light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking up the rinsing button of a train toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, in a kitchen sink there are more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left that he leaned, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to rinsets of toilets, the task posed his immune system definitely among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to live up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test painting showed a luminometric count of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after their Luminometer number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film, he says:" "" "this is the worst thing I have done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended with saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things that I had ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social home after a delogizing with an amount of £50,000 because it terrorised their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were whitewashed, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for housing management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shouting, strife and flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances, old litter was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wood boards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw her fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing made her and her partner forcibly removed from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogizing was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made to Hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one of them said," "" "They didn't care for anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as delogizing is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information we have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers in the house management will now have to evacuate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after having found guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graffiti with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delegate renters who do not obey house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police reported that delogizing was a clear warning to the other tenants unable to abide by the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>

<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Weird Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the state election will not come again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as so far it's not possible: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - it bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the election fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't be allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are also practical problems: during the holidays helpers, hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count out voices at the end, only tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania will have to leave the country over for an election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And there is also something going on: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a coalition of the SPD / CDU, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionable dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chases a little with the people, just as his legendary, eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "has speeded up the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is to make election campaigns at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale surveys; Merkel Bundestag election circle is in the northeast.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "that, coking, plays a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert on his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing:" "" "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot of stake in the game, Sellering called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were at last 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the land day.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30am in the morning and end only at 20 o'clock, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October, everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite of those responsible for the construction works will also be praised, for instance when it comes to setting up residence entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was cancelled, and so that the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the village relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>

<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many roads were looking for and more familiar with their navigation device than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were fraying in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakthroughs leaves everyone who asks them to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="26">The locals are the most exploited along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, proprietor of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it" "" "hard hit" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road renovation was" "" "dropped back for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it points to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now looking less frequently because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't get there, it's also nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his family-klifts come back after the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis, which his host has experienced in her long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prior to commenting on the comment section, under the pseudonym of non-AlleEinheimen's middle-aged men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the above-mentioned resurrection of records is not based on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and stuffy before I stop, hold my hands and say something special like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I run from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already value," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25 working with Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets on YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the media player, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "from the conversations that I have led, people usually discharged themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a store like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans of the record feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl sleeves, from objects that watch joyful singing memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is what I am a collector, and I think it is so with a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way of working spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flutes from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while browsing through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently got in here and said:" I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead LP to put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-like, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who are coming in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the record almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz moans out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but nailing psychological trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates sold for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to my pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group together for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of boards from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is the most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they are disregarded, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with the bumblebees through panels of Berwick Street and the sheets, while they avoid the startling look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary establishments, in which persons within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to final drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes were paid and which would pose a fire and safety risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants often would provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the prefecture of Calais was" "" "absolutely trackable" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just nourishing people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids "Café of the camp which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers must adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in different federal states, among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, the Temposomes will be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident points, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or bridges with temporary speed control, there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in uninterrupted measurement mode, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit prohibitions to time, travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-Series rugby ended on Thursday evening at an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-quilting, back, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss of Wimbledon England.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This stage will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfull and let the attacks bounce off from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau moved around in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A raging tack of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalua came to a showdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new feature since the restart and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while still learning the UK.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinsulan, whose fans sang, swelled flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB did not crush into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in semi-finals with 20-5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the first half forward, but Dan Norton went through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the trainer's Cancer to win a row victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard kieve who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was present when they rowed for the second Olympiagold in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, at least her 39th unfired use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant women who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd, there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the trainer who didn't know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who was operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky enough to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, off the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if it was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group was" "" "Bavarian far than exemplary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the association for 31 years, including 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually transports approx. 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and Weiler with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">For further towns and municipalities there are water supply contracts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn mayoral Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterpartner in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband since 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency deployment on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there have always been new additions because water is living and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Gol's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he actually lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the recipe for success of the Veitenstein group for nitrate cut in front of the Unterfranken Water Forum.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a lot of praise and praise for that.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterman and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">He described the well construction and restructure of the association as high points from his point of view.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the rupture of the pipe at the elevated tank near Kirchberg on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because one filled the high tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-laden and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>

<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imported import duties have an effect on import steel, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how long-lasting the price overhaul is.</seg>

<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp meant not to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: she was a young girl in the school choir, in the Lehramt School she finished music and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels refreshed, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German seniors division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve at age, a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who regularly calls his lungs does not get out of the pudding too fast even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "older people often have a very special effect," "" "says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors Organizations." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who have fallen ill will remember long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a special achievement is demanded, explained Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating on one's voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone exercise so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz reveals.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings out of the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help on the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone wanting to sing should join a choir, advises Hacklers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="6">In this regard, the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life quarter.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two warheads again went up, and another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in detonation close to the beach of Patong, which was popular among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several wounded.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media, too, wanted to recognize a pattern which is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist revolt or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs have been placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have been receiving secret information about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - although they have not been informed of the exact date and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police deployed their officials throughout the country to provide security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace, which was used over years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its homepage to comply with the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution which was drafted by the military junta.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-rate calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach it was established that undercover works for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial enterprises from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Hendertenberg have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Chairman of the Board, Herbert Schmidt showed the body, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over- and undercover from the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious charges raised by the fact that all three sewage plants handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, lying between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs could have a serious impact on several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the recumbent calculation period, refurbishment and repair expenses were incurred in all three plants in a considerable amount not least due to the age of refurbishment and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as approvals, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage in the sewage plant of Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welschahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the water treatment plant in Lopp, the first sewage plant had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to meet the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "for these extraordinary expenses, continued assistance and maintenance costs were incurred, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance" "" "fully hit" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="21">According to the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the above-mentioned facilities will remain precarious, particularly since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage treatment association cannot be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit institution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blameless, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "snapchat filters have been critical in the past in which they were accused of promoting Blackface foe or white skin as a beauty ideal." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and starved cheeks, some reviewers called a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversy had pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant as an homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter recalled vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "hurting and the least said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellowing face has been dragged into the abovelling extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration warfare, from conference rooms to Hollywood and appliances that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people, who are more different than their older counterparts in terms of race, could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting to a user, "it's much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was in the past," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu, for the great part, criticized white male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # Deleteam Snapchat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence service information, rejects Congress Committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information in order to draw a more optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when it allowed the actual conditions on site, an inquiry committee of the Congress filed a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Committee of Conflicts, Intelligence Committees and Armed Budgetary, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically spurred by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly reported a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leading errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press releases, statements and statements prior to Congress were significantly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mozambique could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-year 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched Task Force after they were admitted that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while continuing the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of Centcom reports is underway by the General Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created an overly restricted process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," stated the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaging morals among analysts and" "" "there was little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were taken up by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the Inspector's investigations were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism with regard to the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes between more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush presented only a small occupying force in Iraq and refrained from making thoughts about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker noted that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger Colonel, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having fired three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two matches should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am not one of those who keep their gates in memory." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on the first place in their group with the Briton who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place respectively.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will leave the strong Dutch somewhat longer from the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey mallet in hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the helm all around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a handshake from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the Toralkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a barrel.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the tramp's Zen</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro's events feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning bar, which is passed from the wristwatch to a swimmer to a gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples, would certainly have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the olympic trampoline tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not the same for every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparsely the last 16 years that many of them, I had surveyed, did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete up to 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider character, partly because it is more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devout enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending bouncing - but also the grace of gymnastics and scuba diving, the two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "jumping board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and have to move a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are assessed according to the official course of the Olympic program, according to version, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight forward.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go on in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall, but also another high end in television transmission: the world's or the Olympic medley.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The rebounder of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces down, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant annulment of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen like the competition at the Olympics only can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic Mania, they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthropoids and the objective of male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently proposed - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a sound ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the response of the government was merciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen fired and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader for the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, although dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seeyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-sighted election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this fragile, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can use the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of bending down under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians believed that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian Prime Minister, HaileMaritime Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval was 2005 after thousands of protesters protested, which, according to data from analysts, were apparently fucked by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this period of unrest went over relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty eradication.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the internal misunderstanding of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month Protesters attacked Gondar, an amharan city, businesses run by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a strange position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed its base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile context.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama has been founded in ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had not been seriously meant to be the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who try to protect him during an eventful period of protection, into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rude back in reference to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism jumps down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling survey results on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Clinton's email, but later on, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "according to how the reaction occurs." said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted a more corrosive tone, as its results have gone further." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a large margin in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze brought his loyal comrades into the inconvenient situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, had great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments." "" "Mr Giuliani thus said he was questioned about Mr. Trump's statements if Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that, before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbitches, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread in aggressively taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a fake cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store front were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals toured it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabmp wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempted and club is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it's also new finding.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are garnishes such as capers and acidified onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>

<seg id="8">Coda's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while in her book "97 Orchard" she told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest cooperation, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper publishing house, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>

<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest typhoon is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haired usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland shark only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches just 1.220 meters in average.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6m / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "mad," "" "says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionary biologist has long assumed that Greenland haih will be stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-haie is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland shark.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-motion was to say that she had six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, prey make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland haidens, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest was 502 cm.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins they contain will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search resulted in greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters, the lentil, on the other hand, contained a small amount of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland-haidens had normal carbon-14-amounts in its lenticular-nucleus, that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14-Clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre-long shark-shark, while the record-shark should be even 392 years old with 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to attribute the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haih with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such Methuselites live in icy waters, especially in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon point was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature then later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media clock after he had revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preselection since it had claimed Arab guests according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The mints from the pastoral care unit Eyeshal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were tackled together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next pilgrimage tour of all the mints in the course of two years, the St. Anna District Council decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided in favour of the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the open gate of Mercy on Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Eptelbronn, and Gruene, and Haigerloch, and the holy chambers, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim crosses and distributed the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, he was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Hungarian dear wife is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts in the morning and in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches always made rest to sing together a song from a specially organised pilgrim song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The residences of the local parishioners were available for the nights.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and fortifying dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, the trip to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, had to be lowered at first about 500 metres altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the lake in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg to the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="17">The minis visibly lightened and happily met the Minis in the later afternoon at Freiburg Minster and crossed the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster, Minis, who arrived at the pilgrimage, were greeted by the Minis by cooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims visited the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the city of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner last night in the men team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made. the Jumping and the legend haughted the legend when he stormed home to get a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy claimed the fifth of the six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after finishing in March at the London Rail World Championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement has created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that is now unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set up an olympic record in the qualification laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder lay almost behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, when Hindes went into a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC experts and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," "" "It's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round, we set up an olympic record and beat the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 Triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinderer admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objections to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinderer said:" "" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Reddick, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny comes next in the sprint that will start today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinderer said:" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Robert dly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had contested with representatives before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton technical director in April in the midst of sex and bullying proposals as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="6">This is the clichy story of almost every birthday septum of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris did not have to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians began with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim loves her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were looking to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising of the 832 pages of the tome (615 pages advertisment).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities who modeled "" "" as "" "" models that are celebrities "" "" on the cover. "" "</seg>

<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>

<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the Mistakes of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the misunderstanding, it seems to pass by the point.</seg>

<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect which part of the page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back and forth struggle between the scheduled open source community and the envelopes has been underway since the invention of display lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus probably was once inhabited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still turned on slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also profited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daytime side of the sun for almost two months," explained Mr. GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees colder than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogenomes only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus that we know them today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars revolve around the star cluster to different rates, and in what context the rotational periods are associated with planet creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other Sternenhaufen, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, reach adulthood now.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these poignant stars repel large amounts of star winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star age, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, whereby bigger stars are slower than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," says Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.</seg>
<seg id="4">An educated athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first official doping events in Rio de Janeiro have been known before the seventh day of competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmering Chen Xinyi, 3000 meter obstacle runners silwia Danapowa from Bulgaria and Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critically acclaimed athletics competitions, these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have had to take part in the events of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires full co-operation during the investigation" "", "quoted Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The news about the positive rehearsal at Danapowa was also leaking in the night of Rio, the 33-year-old went on to the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation might be dietary supplements," "" "said the athletic." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it should deal with the banned substance of the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danapowa was suspended preliminary, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately addressed criticism of the athlete's speech.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the sportsmen don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide compress hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail software currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware Defense specialists Malvytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, in part, victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malcauebytes, the perpetrators specialise in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom can be significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwaytes-CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the transition to company attacks was shockingly fast in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for unmodified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage comes from when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decode example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of just a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit margins in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risky gains from ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware repair kits were created by purchasing the malware yourself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "it comes with an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "said Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malvytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful assassination, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwaytes-CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also take entirely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blockaded heating could indeed be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, but only the top of the cockpit is falling.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a seat and offer storage space that is 1,24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk is well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work a bit quieter.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed sensor responds to traffic sign detection and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI-socket are located below the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the petrol engine will receive from 20000 euros, the diesel starting at 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips against Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one is lying around forever, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is already far from the wake-up ring to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not restorative.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wounded, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an in and through sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel particularly sleepy when unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Association of Internal Medicine with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There may be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially frequent in case of depression," says Weber.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are dependent on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can feel bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there's an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises weerer.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve sleep problems, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there is hardly any left-lying dormitory, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, if you have problems with your sleep problems, you should consult your GP first.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with examinations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the study in the sleep laboratory, medical professionals advise for example in snoring with respirators, in case of abnormal daytime fatigue, at dorms or when one does not find the cause of a breakdown incident, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>

<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags and luggage steels as bands.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 hrs, civilian officials at the Düsseldorf airport saw a gang that was known to policemen from past anti-theft offences.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the middle of July this year, the two women and two men had committed several offences and have been working collectively, socially and especially professionally.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When you walk the road from the east to the west, you pass playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a bee store.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "on the facade of a grey house someone has sprayed" "" "ugly!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company called Friedrichshain, will however be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the occupants have rented leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly Berlin's internal senator Henkel has claimed repeatedly for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the premises on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, police patrolling the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked out parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protection from the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin inner senator and police between house-occupiers and their neighbours make up, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working class district, which also today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated under great police force in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elective headliners from around the world: with them residents from GDR times and former domestic occupiers are now sharing their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rental rates, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: you can see them on inserted slices or freshly painted facades that have been tipped with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury statistics are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make property damage, which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years besides the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect's architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer lived consciously in the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important for her to get back her street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings that the old inhabitants squeeze.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are actually condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who don't feel so well are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out people who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a tavern area, can complain bad about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group for refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else interferes with.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-making woolen milchyard, which is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less ridiculing rather than relying on the wide variety of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, just an egg-like wool milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organising, working with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50 percent position to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honorable and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there will be new containers in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office of the Landratsamt to the municipality and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Up to now, it does not work, but one has to rely on private dwellings, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be validated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are soon placed in the washing street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be undressed or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do not-for-profit work - and that motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no occupational therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But action does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also jump here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is essential that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority were motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems, says customer honest," "" "people with whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalization after recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly," "" "some may call naive." "" "a residual risk could and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins put them in ruins completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers must look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new stoke of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics hates itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customers also make it clear that the Urbach is already busy integrating so far into the existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
